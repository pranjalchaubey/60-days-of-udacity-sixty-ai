Day 4:
- Studied the #reading_paper_discuss publication, this time to details. Here is a link to the paper:
It discusses the fundamentals of federated learning and implements an algorithm that incorporates DP to federated learning such that all clients' identities  and data are protected and while the model accuracy is not so much compromised. Indeed, the fundamentals for Lesson 3 of this course.
- Breezed through lesson 3 locally on my machine and will complete this lesson all the exercises tomorrow (this is my plan for tomorrow).
- Received the first review draft on article on fundamental terminologies of deep learning. I was able to get a Google Engineer to review it. :star-struck::star-struck:. Should publish this week.

====
Deployed vectorkit to pypi
----------------------------------------------https://pypi.org/project/vectorkit/
What I have achieved, by implementing these concepts,
is the appreciation of some of the under-the-hood workings of
AI, data science libraries. It is easier to use tools when we
understand how they work.
I also implemented a functionality that lets you visualize
how a calculation was made using the vectors given. With that,
I hope it will help users who want to understand the math.
More on that tomorrow...
Guide to funtionality at:https://github.com/ayivima/vectortools/blob/master/README.rsthttps://github.com/ayivima/vectortools
I also went through source code of the popular scikit-learn

Hi @jaintj95! For graphics I use Photoshop (alternative is Gimp). For notes, I use a simple text editor or a Jupyter Notebook, in case I want to play around with code. But, I also take handwritten notes, because I remember handwritten ones better than typed ones. Good luck, Tejas, but I am sure you will make it to stage2

Day 5:
I am going to dive in a world of tkinter which is a package for building graphical interfaces in Python for desktop applications. My goal is to write a designer that will construct an image classification neural network for Python.
Day 4:
RESULTS: I dealt with Slack API and understood how to pass OAth authentification to start programming in Slack Python SDK. There were 3 main drawbacks:
1) Installing slackclient does not actually give you access to this library. You have to import slack not slackclient as wrongly said in documentation. I checked site-packages for slackclient and there is nothing there that will point out that it is working. It is just a bunch of reading files. I guess it is in the development stage. Although it is used to work before some date.
2) You have to deal with OAth to get access to Slack API but it is not working in Spyder or Jupyter Notebook because there is an event loop running already that blocks Flask functioning. Install PyCharm to handle that.
3) redirect_path is yet another problem that I faced but it is solved by reading a documentation and tuning settings in Slack API.
Enjoy the challenge!

Day 4: Mon 1 Jul 2019
1. Java self study:
- Finished I/O
- Started Object-Oriented Programming: started with basic steps of grasping general ideas such as abstraction, information hiding or encapsulation.
- turned basic sum process into method
- My path setting raised some error, so re-set up the directory
2. Udacity: Secure and Private AI Challenge
- Lesson 6 started
- PATE analysis function, “perform_analysis”- ‘teacher_indices’ has changed to ‘indices’. (In video, it was “teacher_indices”, but kept generating errors!, so I googled it in the code, and found out the name of the variable has changed!)
- To run the ‘perform_analysis’ function, we put (teacher_preds, indices, noise_eps, delta, moments)
- When we removed more values (== replaced more and more values with zeros), there came a warning sign that “Warning: May not have used enough values of l. Increase 'moments' variable and run again.”
- So, we increased the value of moments to 20!
- Still, I don’t really grasp the whole ideas surrounding this analysis, but I will take a look more specifically, and review more, to understand more and better.

@hawk.praxs533 first you go through the paper and understand what its trying to propose. For this paper, its about proposing a VGG16 model with a validation accuracy of 94.68%
The hyperparameters being proposed here:
--> optimizer: SGD
--> momentum: 0.9
--> learning rate: 0.001
--> decay rate: 0.000001
So, while implementing the VGG16 model along with SGD optimizer, all I need to do is give those corresponding values. But in the end, its really about data cleaning, data labeling and data augmentation.

1. Finally uploaded the entire SIIM pneumothorax dicom dataset to Kaggle (~2GB), which took more than a couple of hours.
2. Played with the dataset on Kaggle to try and get an intuitive sense of the project, wrote some code to process the training set files in the process. Managed to view one dicom file at a time for a patient with pneumothorax. Discovered that we might need to split the training data into two sets for effective processing, otherwise Kaggle would throw an error.
3. Dug deeper into further literature on texture classification.
4. Reviewed some neural networks concepts.

I learnt that if we have unlabelled dataset then to annotate them with labels we can simply follow few steps - firstly we need to find similar organisations having same kind of datasets and they all have same kind of labels and then they train their models on their private datasets and give predictions , then i use that all that predictions to  find the most highest prediction and then using DP query , i label them finally. participated in #reading_paper_discuss quiz on Cynthia Dwork's Book chapter 1 and chaper 2 reading material and scored 70% .https://github.com/AceEviliano/Reading-Facebook-Secure-and-Private-AI-Scholarship Participated in #ama_sessions from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm.

Day 4:
I recently listened to a podcast by Katharine Jarmul (https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-security-privacy-gdpr) about the impact of pseudonymization and anonymization in terms of achieving gold standard in data privacy and security.
She tackled portions of the GDPR and how companies are complying to this newly formed regulation.
This is a great deal especially when we tackle Secure and Private AI. As the limits of what AI can do can be daunting, it is a must for the companies who are on the AIs bleeding edge to protect consumers through techniques aforementioned.
A huge takeaway of the day is from the GDPR guidance between anonymization and pseudonymization:
Once data is truly anonymised and individuals are no longer identifiable, the data will not fall within the scope of the GDPR and it becomes easier to use.#60daysofudacityWhat are the biggest challenges currently facing data security and privacy? What does the GDPR mean for civilians, working data scientists and businesses around the world? Is data anonymization actually possible or a pipe dream?

Sorry for late reply. Here you go: https://sandipanweb.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/autonomous-driving-car-detection-with-yolo-in-python/In this article, object detection using the very powerful YOLO model will be described, particularly in the context of car detection for autonomous driving. This problem appeared as an assignment in the coursera course Convolution Networks which is a part of the Deep Learning Specialization (taught by Prof. Andrew Ng.,  from Stanford and , the lecture videos corresponding to the YOLO algorithm can be found here).  The problem description is taken straightaway from the assignment.
Given a set of images (a car detection dataset), the goal is to detect objects (cars) in those images using a pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, with bounding boxes. Many of the ideas are from the two original YOLO papers: Redmon et al., 2016  and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016 .
Some Theory
Let’s first clear the concepts regarding classification, localization, detection and how the object detection problem can be transformed to supervised machine learning problem and subsequently can be solved using a deep convolution neural network. As can be seen from the next figure,
Image classification with localization aims to find the location of an object in an image by not only classifying the image (e.g., a binary classification problem: whether there is a car in an image or not), but also finding a bounding box around the object, if one found.
Detection goes a level further by aiming to identify multiple instances of same/ different types of objects, by marking their locations (the localization problem usually tries to find a single object location).
The localization problem can be converted to a supervised machine learning multi-class classification problem in the following way: in addition to the class label of the object to be identified, the output vector corresponding to an input training image must also contain the location (bounding box coordinates relative to image size) of the object.
A typical output data vector will contain 8 entries for a 4-class classification, as shown in the next figure, the first entry will correspond to whether or not an object of any from the 3 classes of objects. In case one is present in an image, the next 4 entries will define the bounding box containing the object, followed by 3 binary values for the 3 class labels indicating the class of the object. In case none of the objects are present, the first entry will be 0 and the others will be ignored.
 
Now moving from localization to detection, one can proceed in two steps as shown below in the next figure: first use small tightly cropped images to train a convolution neural net for image classification and then use sliding windows of different window sizes (smaller to larger) to classify a test image within that window using the convnet learnt and run the windows sequentially through the entire image, but it’s infeasibly slow computationally.
However, as shown in the next figure, the convolutional implementation of the sliding windows by replacing the fully-connected layers by 1×1 filters makes it possible to simultaneously classify the image-subset inside all possible sliding windows parallelly, making it much more efficient computationally.
 
The convolutional sliding windows, although computationally much more efficient, still has the problem of detecting the accurate bounding boxes, since the boxes don’t align with the sliding windows and the object shapes also tend to be different.
YOLO algorithm overcomes this limitation by dividing a training image into grids and assigning an object to a grid if and only if the center of the object falls inside the grid, that way each object in a training image can get assigned to exactly one grid and then the corresponding bounding box is represented by the coordinates relative to the grid. The next figure described the details of the algorithm.
In the test images, multiple adjacent grids may think that an object actually belongs to them, in order to resolve the iou (intersection of union) measure is used to find the maximum overlap and the non-maximum-suppression algorithm is used to discard all the other bounding boxes with low-confidence of containing an object, keeping the one with the highest confidence among the competing ones and discard the others.
Still there is a problem of multiple objects falling in the same grid. Multiple anchor boxes (of different shapes) are used to resolve the problem, each anchor box of a particular shape being likely to eventually detect  an object of a particular shape.
 
The following figure shows the slides taken from the presentation You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection in the CVPR 2016 summarizing the algorithm:
Problem Statement
Let’s assume that we are working on a self-driving car. As a critical component of this project, we’d like to first build a car detection system. To collect data, we’ve mounted a camera to the hood (meaning the front) of the car, which takes pictures of the road ahead every few seconds while we drive around.
The above pictures are taken from a car-mounted camera while driving around Silicon Valley.  We would like to especially thank  for providing this dataset!  is a company building the brains of self-driving vehicles.
We’ve gathered all these images into a folder and have labelled them by drawing bounding boxes around every car we found. Here’s an example of what our bounding boxes look like.
Definition of a box
 
If we have 80 classes that we want YOLO to recognize, we can represent the class label c either as an integer from 1 to 80, or as an 80-dimensional vector (with 80 numbers) one component of which is 1 and the rest of which are 0. Here we will use both representations, depending on which is more convenient for a particular step.
In this exercise, we shall learn how YOLO works, then apply it to car detection. Because the YOLO model is very computationally expensive to train, we will load pre-trained weights for our use.  The instructions for how to do it can be obtained from here and here.
 
YOLO
YOLO (“you only look once“) is a popular algorithm because it achieves high accuracy while also being able to run in real-time. This algorithm “only looks once” at the image in the sense that it requires only one forward propagation pass through the network to make predictions. After non-max suppression, it then outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.
Model details
First things to know:
The input is a batch of images of shape (m, 608, 608, 3).
The output is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes. Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers (pc,bx,by,bh,bw,c) as explained above. If we expand c into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding box is then represented by 85 numbers.
We will use 5 anchor boxes. So we can think of the YOLO architecture as the following: IMAGE (m, 608, 608, 3) -> DEEP CNN -> ENCODING (m, 19, 19, 5, 85).
Let’s look in greater detail at what this encoding represents.
Encoding architecture for YOLO
If the center/midpoint of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is responsible for detecting that object.
Since we are using 5 anchor boxes, each of the 19 x19 cells thus encodes information about 5 boxes. Anchor boxes are defined only by their width and height.
For simplicity, we will flatten the last two last dimensions of the shape (19, 19, 5, 85) encoding. So the output of the Deep CNN is (19, 19, 425).
Flattening the last two last dimensions
 
Now, for each box (of each cell) we will compute the following element-wise product and extract a probability that the box contains a certain class.
Find the class detected by each box
Here’s one way to visualize what YOLO is predicting on an image:
For each of the 19×19 grid cells, find the maximum of the probability scores (taking a max across both the 5 ancho…

Day 4: complete Lesson 3  Here is Lecture Note: https://github.com/Iamsdt/60daysofudacity/blob/master/day4/day4.md Read some articles about Transfer learning CNN Start reading Book: Deep learning By Ian Goodfellow Book link: https://www.deeplearningbook.org/### What Is Differential Privacy

Differential privacy started from 2013

**Goal:** ensure different kinds of statistical analysis don't 
compromise privacy

**Def:**
Privacy is preserved if, after the analysis, the analyzer doesn't know 
anything about the people in the dataset. They remain ""unobserved"".

In 1977, a reasonable definition was proposed which was this,
""Anything that can be learned from a participant in a statistical database,
can be learned without access to the database"".

This definition is basically saying, anything you actually do learn 
about a person should be only public information. 
This definition assumes that information which was been made public 
elsewhere isn't harmful to an individual.

**Cynthia Dwork**
""Differential privacy"" describes a promise, made by a data holder, or 
curator, to a data subject, and the promise is like this, ""You will not
 be affected, adversely or otherwise, by allowing your data to be used 
 in any study or analysis, no matter what other studies, data sets, or 
 information sources, are available."" 
 
 **Reference Book:** The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy
 
### Can We Just Anonymize Data
""no matter what other studies, data sets, or 
information sources, are available"" this is the key issue. 

Basically, datasets are anonymized during preparation. For instance, 
Netflix published an anonymized dataset, but the user name and movie 
name have been replaced by the unique Integer.
But two researcher de-anonymized this dataset by scraping IMDB

### Introducing The Canonical Database

    import torch
    num_entries = 5000
    db = torch.rand(num_entries) > 0.5
    db
    

Imagine we have a database with just one column, so the definition of privacy in the context of this simple database.  

We performing query against the database,
If we remove a person from the database and the query doesn't change, 
then that person's privacy would be fully protected. 

In other words, if the query doesn't change after we remove someone 
from the database, then that person wasn't leaking any statistical 
information into the output of the query.

Day 4: Read the article https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/06/15/what-is-differential-privacy/ for differential privacyYesterday at the WWDC keynote, Apple announced a series of new security and privacy features, including one feature that’s drawn a bit of attention — and confusion. Specifically, Apple announced that they will be using a technique called “Differential Privacy” (henceforth: DP) to improve the privacy of their data collection practices.
The reaction to this by most people has been a big “???”, since few people have even heard of Differential Privacy, let alone understand what it means. Unfortunately Apple isn’t known for being terribly open when it comes to sharing the secret sauce that drives their platform, so we’ll just have to hope that at some point they decide to publish more. What we know so far comes from Apple’s iOS 10 Preview guide:
Starting with iOS 10, Apple is using Differential Privacy technology to help discover the usage patterns of a large number of users without compromising individual privacy. To obscure an individual’s identity, Differential Privacy adds mathematical noise to a small sample of the individual’s usage pattern. As more people share the same pattern, general patterns begin to emerge, which can inform and enhance the user experience. In iOS 10, this technology will help improve QuickType and emoji suggestions, Spotlight deep link suggestions and Lookup Hints in Notes.
To make a long story short, it sounds like Apple is going to be collecting a lot more data from your phone. They’re mainly doing this to make their services better, not to collect individual users’ usage habits. To guarantee this, Apple intends to apply sophisticated statistical techniques to ensure that this aggregate data — the statistical functions it computes over all your information — don’t leak your individual contributions. In principle this sounds pretty good. But of course, the devil is always in the details.
While we don’t have those details, this seems like a good time to at least talk a bit about what Differential Privacy is, how it can be achieved, and what it could mean for Apple — and for your iPhone.
The motivation
In the past several years, “average people” have gotten used to the idea that they’re sending a hell of a lot of personal information to the various services they use. Surveys also tell us they’re starting to feel uncomfortable about it.
This discomfort makes sense when you think about companies using our personal data to market (to) us. But sometimes there are decent motivations for collecting usage information. For example, Microsoft recently announced a tool that can diagnose pancreatic cancer by monitoring your Bing queries. Google famously runs Google Flu Trends. And of course, we all benefit from crowdsourced data that improves the quality of the services we use — from mapping applications to restaurant reviews.
Unfortunately, even well-meaning data collection can go bad. For example, in the late 2000s, Netflix ran a competition to develop a better film recommendation algorithm. To drive the competition, they released an “anonymized” viewing dataset that had been stripped of identifying information. Unfortunately, this de-identification turned out to be insufficient. In a well-known piece of work, Narayanan and Shmatikov showed that such datasets could be used to re-identify specific users — and even predict their political affiliation! — if you simply knew a little bit of additional information about a given user.
This sort of thing should be worrying to us. Not just because companies routinely share data (though they do) but because breaches happen, and because even statistics about a dataset can sometimes leak information about the individual records used to compute it. Differential Privacy is a set of tools that was designed to address this problem.
What is Differential Privacy?
Differential Privacy is a privacy definition that was originally developed by Dwork, Nissim, McSherry and Smith, with major contributions by many others over the years. Roughly speaking, what it states can summed up intuitively as follows:
Imagine you have two otherwise identical databases, one with your information in it, and one without it. Differential Privacy ensures that the probability that a statistical query will produce a given result is (nearly) the same whether it’s conducted on the first or second database.
One way to look at this is that DP provides a way to know if your data has a significant effect on the outcome of a query. If it doesn’t, then you might as well contribute to the database — since there’s almost no harm that can come of it. Consider a silly example:
Imagine that you choose to enable a reporting feature on your iPhone that tells Apple if you like to use the 💩  emoji routinely in your iMessage conversations. This report consists of a single bit of information: 1 indicates you like 💩 , and 0 doesn’t. Apple might receive these reports and fill them into a huge database. At the end of the day, it wants to be able to derive a count of the users who like this particular emoji.
It goes without saying that the simple process of “tallying up the results” and releasing them does not satisfy the DP definition, since computing a sum on the database that contains your information will potentially produce a different result from computing the sum on a database without it. Thus, even though these sums may not seem to leak much information, they reveal at least a little bit about you. A key observation of the Differential Privacy research is that in many cases, DP can be achieved if the tallying party is willing to add random noise to the result. For example, rather than simply reporting the sum, the tallying party can inject noise from a Laplace or gaussian distribution, producing a result that’s not quite exact — but that masks the contents of any given row. (For other interesting functions, there are many other techniques as well.)
Even more usefully, the calculation of “how much” noise to inject can be made without knowing the contents of the database itself (or even its size). That is, the noise calculation can be performed based only on knowledge of the function to be computed, and the acceptable amount of data leakage.
A tradeoff between privacy and accuracy
Now obviously calculating the total number of 💩 -loving users on a system is a pretty silly example. The neat thing about DP is that the same overall approach can be applied to much more interesting functions, including complex statistical calculations like the ones used by Machine Learning algorithms. It can even be applied when many different functions are all computed over the same database.
But there’s a big caveat here. Namely, while the amount of “information leakage” from a single query can be bounded by a small value, this value is not zero. Each time you query the database on some function, the total “leakage” increases — and can never go down. Over time, as you make more queries, this leakage can start to add up.
This is one of the more challenging aspects of DP. It manifests in two basic ways:
The more information you intend to “ask” of your database, the more noise has to be injected in order to minimize the privacy leakage. This means that in DP there is generally a fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and privacy, which can be a big problem when training complex ML models.
Once data has been leaked, it’s gone. Once you’ve leaked as much data as your calculations tell you is safe, you can’t keep going — at least not without risking your users’ privacy. At this point, the best solution may be to just to destroy the database and start over. If …

I'm planning to rewatch some of them, because I think it is important to know this very well to have a solid basis. Involvement in the slack community. I'd like to remark a thread about online master programmes and how they are considered when applying for jobs (I find this an interesting topic to continue discussing about it). I went through some online resources as well, when I read in different ways about Differential privscy:https://www.infoq.com/articles/differential-privacy-intro/https://medium.com/georgian-impact-blog/a-brief-introduction-to-differential-privacy-eacf8722283b
Today I encourage @dubeankit07 (who I saw introducing himself today. Never too late! ) and @ishanarora24  to get involved in this :bananadance: :bananadance: :bananadance:
*#60daysofudacity*Differential privacy leapt from research papers to tech news headlines last year when, in the WWDC keynote, Apple VP of Engineering Craig Federighi announced Apple’s use of the concept to protect user privacy in iOS. This article gives a definition of differential privacy and example of differentially private algorithms.Aaruran ElamurugaiyanReading time10 min read

Day 1/60
I had to reset my progress (though I did one day only so far, so it’s not that bad). I had pretty busy few weeks and I needed two days to unwind and nothing :upside_down_face:
Now I did some review of my progress for half an hour and started reading pytorch documentation cause I need a little more information about the whole thing. I am still at lesson 1, which I guess is not far and I was able to do the tasks but I feel I need a little more information about pytorch in general  cause my knowledge so far was a bit superficial I guess. I guess I am doing this for an hour and a half today :-)
Again I don’t know many people here, so I am going to invite first two people that appear after @C, cause C is first letter of my surname 
So, @aargonzalezbe  and @abhi021997 - join the challenge if you haven’t already and tell us all how you are doing :-)

1) Completed Chapter 4 with my notes on Medium and shared with our community : https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJCJJQ42W/p1562011958275400
2) Playing with the ""Project: Perform a Differencing Attack on Row 10""
3) helping other by replying of their questions
4) motivating others from channels
5) planning meetup with the all RomaniansHi, please feel free to check my notes related to this lesson https://medium.com/@calincan2000/my-notes-from-lesson-4-evaluating-the-privacy-of-a-function-9aebfaa859dc  :dark_sunglasses:

*Day: 2/60*
Today I engage in the community sharing ideas and reading some suggested papers. I recommend https://unpaywall.org/ this tool for getting rid of (some) paywalls legally.
Also updated the lessons notes a bit.
I start to feel like 30 minutes a day is not enough I have to much to do still and few time. I will try to dedicate more on the following days, but today unfortunately is what I could do.

""Intuitively, we want to be able to query our database and evaluate whether or not the result of the query is leaking \""private\"" information. As mentioned previously, this is about evaluating whether the output of a query changes when we remove someone from the database. Specifically, we want to evaluate the *maximum* amount the query changes when someone is removed (maximum over all possible people who could be removed).

*Day Four:* Lesson 3, Introducing Differential Privacy, finished :rakette:
An awesome introduction and the example of the *linkage attack* done in the NETFLIX database was simply incredible. Privacy preserving is really hard and challenging! Shoutout to @karan_kishinani, @prakhar.tripathi2205, @deepak.sharma.it.1992, @abhisheklalwani96, @naushadshukoor, @shudiptotrafder for sharing their thoughts about this topic in a small thread today  I also read today the first chapter (“The promise of differential privacy”) of Dwork’s book. It was an excellent companion for the lesson I did today  I found and old text of mine about the impostor syndrom and shared it at #busy_or_overwhelmed. It was really interesting, that words of my old me served as help for my present me Revised lesson 2 and plan on doing a cheatsheet about it. I have no experience on it, though, so I would thank anyone who can recommend me programs for doing them  Attended and participated on today’s AMA and #tech_help (thanks @yemissi.kifouly, by the way ) :alert:. Converted my daily two minutes of wisdom into a quote for the QOTW  :bunny-stars:.
My daily encouragements go to @mikaelaysanchez, @abhisheklalwani96, @apoorvagni (hero of the day, haha), and of course to @sfmajors373!

3. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06720.pdf
4. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08623.pdf  and many others
What I found out is that, the best way to learn #deep_learning, as said by the great Yoshua Bengio is reading papers and implementing them.. That seems so very true now...Loving this experience...
Day 3 : Read  some blogs regarding CNN and  implemented them on my project to make a CNN so robust that it can achieve rotational     equivarience.. Attended a conference at #Indian_Institute_of_Science on Probabiilty
Day 4 : Tested my model but... it was not performing well during  testing time , so it's time to curate a dataset.. Was going through some Intermediate courses on DataCamp for a brief recapitulation..
Day 5: A little bit of #l1_deep_learn_pytorch revision is required, and then on #l2_intro_diff_privacy revision and keep on working with the model
Sorry @akshit for such delay in posting of the progress, as I got very much involved in order to make the model working  properly, that I forgot everything.. Now I can see a beam of light  in the darkness.. #keep_learning #Pytorch #udacity #60daysofudacityMany classes of images exhibit rotational symmetry. Convolutional neural networks are sometimes trained using data augmentation to exploit this, but they are still required to learn the rotation...We introduce Group equivariant Convolutional Neural Networks (G-CNNs), a natural generalization of convolutional neural networks that reduces sample complexity by exploiting symmetries. G-CNNs use...

Yes its kinda answered in combination of this two questions:
*Q7. I have to go on vacation and won’t have access to the internet but I will keep learning and studying. Can I update my progress of all days when I get back from vacation?*
A.7: Sorry but that will not be possible because we need to track the daily updates on Slack in the #60daysofudacity channel to keep track of everyone participating’s progress. But don’t worry. We are planning on launching soon a shorter version of #60daysofudacity.
*Q.8: What happens if I skip 1 day of #60daysofudacity? Must all 60 days be consecutive days?*
A.8: Participants can take 2 days off every 2 weeks without that being held against them.

1 - PMI is still training, I think that it is taking too long because dumping all wikipedia data was not good idea.
2 - Yesterday, I implemented a RNN to handle skip-gram models and it is yielding some poor results, maybe it is naturally a bad idea, or maybe I made some major mistakes with the skip-gram part. Ideas?
3 - I started reading RNN chapter in Goodfellow's book (and wow what a description).
4 - For day 6 (today, since I could barely read slack yesterday), I am planning to work on the RNN for skip-gram and follow slack closely.

Today I have been working in Section 1 - I am trying to keep the code dry, I managed to work on lesson 1 and 2 (Toy Differential Privacy - Simple Database Queries and Towards Evaluating The Differential Privacy of a Function) but explanation and more functionality is still needed.
I also engaged a bit in the community.
I am a bit afraid about tomorrow since I have no idea if I will have internet to post here. But hopefully I will.

Day 6/60:
Recently, I became interested in Human Pose Estimation. After doing some research, I found various papers online regarding that and I was interested in the OpenPose paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008v2.pdf). So, I began reading it and it is one of the toughest papers to understand that I have encountered till now. I have spent 4 hrs today and read only 4 pages out of 14. But, it is an interesting Computer Vision application and I am very excited to have started this.
So, today I read the paper and have started taking notes to simplify my understanding.
I had to wind up early today or I could have given it at least 3 more hours, but, I am definitely going to keep pursuing it and my next couple of days will all be related to this only.
I would like to invite @rajabhardwaj1989 and @abhishekuniyal09 to start this #60daysofudacity soon. This has been an awesome journey so far and we are in the initial stages! So excited for the wonders that await for us.

Hi @manishajhunjhunwala7 ! Briefly, I have two ""big"" projects in mind. One would be developing a DL algorithm for computer vision able to recognise and count moving targets that overlap during recording ( example application: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eksXaZdx_GY). The second one would be developing a reinforcement learning algorithm for a manipulator or humanoid robot using some physics simulator like Mujoco or OpenSim (http://osim-rl.stanford.edu/). In my opinion the first project can highly benefit from an adequate foundation and relation with shallow learning and mathematics behind. So, I am also wondering about proposing kind of a ""beginner implementations"" study group eager to deep and challenge themselves into foundations (I have already found three participants that might be interested on this group).

Hi @manishajhunjhunwala7 . Our team project is to make t-shirts and other swag for the participants in this challenge and to give folks a chance to do a project. Students will be able to submit images they’ve generated using machine learning algorithms (GAN, style transfer), we’ll vote on the winners, and we’ll print the winners on products and donate the proceeds to charity.

Day 3:  To Understand:
How can anyone defend against an adversary who has unknown, and possibly unlimited, help from the outside world? Differential privacy offers a solution. Differentially-private algorithms are resilient to adaptive attacks that use auxiliary information.
These algorithms rely on incorporating random noise into the mix so that everything an adversary receives becomes noisy and imprecise, and so it is much more difficult to breach privacy (if it is feasible at all).  Sources[If interested to read]: https://t.co/fIuWuYQlsv

1. Udacity: Lesson6, started from 5.Where to Go From Here part to 6 and 7, listened to three guests interviews. From the ch5, I got to know the right attitude toward this DP learning, that it is somewhat new area, and I should deploy things with extra attention, compared to other tasks, and also helpful reading sources. Furthermore, the three ppl's interviews were so inspiring and cooool! I really got full charged to learn, understand, and deploy this DP by studying and practicing more! This was the first time that I really thanked Uda for this precious learning material, and course design. THANKS!
2. Java Self Study: make class for the object oriented computing! (Made calculator class that has sum, and average methods in it)
3. NVIDIA AI Conference in Seoul, South Korea: I attended this AI conference today. NVIDA Keynote was delivered by Mark Hamilton, VP, and after that I could pick 6 different sessions from experts in diverse fields. I took 3 sessions from NVIDIA engineers that introducing their cutting-edge technical applications like DALI which can be deployed to acceleration in image augmentation, getting higher acceleration using Tensor Cores and AMP, and how to add custom CUDA C++ for boosting BERT Inference. Also, a tech leader in NAVER, which is like Google in Korean search engine, introduced what they are working on to provide better image, and speech solutions. This was also very interesting. And at the last session, I attended to the session from Raj Mirpuri in NVIDIA, and got to know not only the GPU technology itself but also the price efficiency of it has evolved vastly.
In conclusion: Great Day 5 of mine!

Since I had some experience working with natural language processing in R particularly the text prediction, I am inclined into learning how it is done in Python.
Milestones for today:
1. Understanding the mathematical intuition behind word2vec where words/tokens are one-hot encoded to create a numpy array suitable for training.
2. Applying word embeddings using numpy to a toy example with 10 sentences using tuples where the key is the token and the value is its neighbor which is applied to all tokens (done using numpy and pandas).
3. Review the intuition behind LSTMs and neural bottlenecks to decrease the dimensionality of vector space for easy learning.#60daysofudacity

1. Finished the code for the preliminary phase of data-processing for Kaggle group project... Extracted the training set images and masks originally in dicom format as numpy array objects. Determined a small sample of the data are of subjects with on signs of pneumothorax based on no masks provided. Tested showing one image both as dicom file and as numpy array data using matplotlib to check if there is any discrepancy, especially in terms of quality. Everything turned out alright. Due to the sensitive nature of the group Kaggle kernel at this stage the code cannot be shared yet. But definitely feeling more comfortable working with dicom data. https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview
2. Reviewed some more neural network concepts in preparation for the Kaggle competition and individual project on hockey analytics.
3. Drafted a repo for the web scrapping part of hockey analytics project but will need debugging to make everything work. The individual project will make use of a small (hence toy-like) dataset from the Hong Kong Hockey Association, and will be used for predicting performance of the Valley RFC hockey teams based on past performances. Some preliminary data has been scrapped from their site already, and am currently stored in personal computer in two files for the men's and the women's.

Day 1:Learned Lesson 3: Course 1-7Pomodoro Technique.
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
There are six steps in the original technique:Decide on the task to be done.Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).[1]Work on the task.End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.[5]If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
Personally, I use a pomodoro timer of 40 minutes.
I also found great apps for applying this technique: Brain Focus, Forest: Stay focused.

*Day 3/60*Did the kernel setup on Kaggle for 'Aerial Cactus Identification' (Familiarized myself for using PyTorch on Kaggle)Worked on resolving an issue on my system where Jupyter Notebook fails to launch due to multiple errors encountered. Devoted quite a bit of time before reinstalling Anaconda Navigator.Continued watching Lesson 3 (Evaluating the Privacy of a function)
It was a very hectic day at work and just made time to complete day 3.
What i would have dumped on the next day generally, I did it today, thanks to #60daysofudacity.
Sending out motivation to @f2014360 and @arkachkrbrty!

Due to some personal issues, I could start my #60daysofudacity today. It doesn't matter to me if the course is ending earlier than my pledge, the most important is to learn!!
I have finished all the lessons already so I am reviewing the course again, because the first time you really miss a lot of details.
Day 1:
- Rewatched Lesson 2 and 3, took notes
- Started a video course on Federated Learning with Tensorflow, I am just curious
- Started to work on my Federated Learning project

""In this section we're going to play around with Differential Privacy in the context of a database query. The database is going to be a VERY simple database with only one boolean column. Each row corresponds to a person. Each value corresponds to whether or not that person has a certain private attribute (such as whether they have a certain disease, or whether they are above/below a certain age). We are then going to learn how to know whether a database query over such a small database is differentially private or not - and more importantly - what techniques are at our disposal to ensure various levels of privacy\n"",

""Intuitively, we want to be able to query our database and evaluate whether or not the result of the query is leaking \""private\"" information. As mentioned previously, this is about evaluating whether the output of a query changes when we remove someone from the database. Specifically, we want to evaluate the *maximum* amount the query changes when someone is removed (maximum over all possible people who could be removed). So, in order to evaluate how much privacy is leaked, we're going to iterate over each person in the database and measure the difference in the output of the q…

*What I learn:*
In this lesson I learn that it is possible to guest some of the distribution of the data applying simple arithmetic functions. Moreover, one can guest the individuals identity in a database. This means, we must implement the necessary mechanisms to guarantee the privacy in databases.

Day 2 out of 60 (so still lots of learning ahead of me, yay! :)
1. I signed up for virtual meetup on Sunday, can't wait to meet you all. I will try to squeeze in more meetups this week, but time conversions are tricky (it shows local time for organizer so when I factored in time change, it appears that many are taking place the same time  )
2. I did 60 minute blitz for 30 minutes, and officially this blitz will take me more than 60 minutes (I google a lot things that get me interested, so I get derailed and distracted, but also I learn a lot more, so yay again  ).
3. I did ""Intro to pytorch"" for circa hour and a half - isn't part 7 just cuteness overload? I guess I should subtract time I've spent looking at those beautiful pets, but who can count that? :woman-shrugging: not me  gue
4. I guess I finished ""Intro to pytorch"" today. I am very happy

- Discussed to form a study group for coding shallow and then more advanced networks

-| One consists on developing DL for computer vision so as to recognise moving targets that may overlap during recording ( example application: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eksXaZdx_GY).
-| The second one focuses on reinforcement learning algorithm by trying to code an algorithm using for training some physics simulator like Mujoco or OpenSim (http://osim-rl.stanford.edu/).

So the results are very interesting because the model holds up (and really well). I have trained the teachers with only 3 labels and the accuracy of the ensemble over the public data is almost the same (difference on the third decimal point) and what is really amazing is that the privacy budget is lower!

Day 4: 02.07.2019@jaikirao1 shared a github link named ""Most Cited Deep Learning Papers"": https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers
I read this post and found two interesting papers. Please, let me present these:
1. Deep neural networks are easily fooled: High confidence predictions for unrecognizable images (2015), A. Nguyen et al.
This show a lot of example about fooling an NN.  Unfortunately the author doesn't write exact networks, but the concept is interesting and disturbing at the same time. Maybe MNIST would be familiar to everybody. ;)
2. Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks (2014), M. Zeiler and R. Fergus
This is a fantastic paper. I think everybody must read. Great examples helps you to understand the layers and their usefulness. When you read, please check Table 3. It shows the error rates with various architecture. This helps you to build better networks.
I hope, you like these papers too. If you read them and want to talk about them, please write me. Let's face with Day 5. :) #60daysofudacityThe most cited deep learning papersStars19199LanguageTeX

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Happy to finish implementing playground, a functionality
in vectorkit that lets you see how your vector arithmetic
was done. I believe this will be useful for learning. Hopefully, it should work with Jupyter Notebooks soon.
A snapshot is below. It takes your input and explains or shows you how calculations were done with your inputs and the final answer.
2. Munched on Pytorch Source Code...
3. Had a virtual meeting with @vivekspace94, over possible use
of RNN for a project still under discussion.

I am still thinking about what projects I should do, but I have some ideas about liver cancers (very clinically related). Your project sounds interesting. Do you use several common used scores and combine them to predict the risks? Or do you find out risk factors in your research?

I would do it even if you won’t complete it. I think this challenge course is first and foremost about learning new stuff and 60 days of Udacity will help you with learning more.
As for a second part, definitely start from 1/60. Anything other would seem dishonest.
But it is just my opinion, maybe moderators of this channel or @akshit will tell how it is for real.

Day 5 #60DaysOfUdacity one way to improve survey participant privacy is to use the 2 coin toss method: 1st  coin dictates if the user answers honestly. If not, second coin decides 50/50 whether they will answer yes or no. This gives each individual ""plausible deniability"" so as to prevent leaky info. Statistically, the analyst will still be able to determine roughly true estimates without sacrificing individual privacy. Awesome!

Day 6: Continued coding lesson 6 project (part 3/3). Added laplacian noise and retrained the model with the differentially private labels, but I'm getting very low accuracy despite the labels seem correct. I suspect it's due to incorrect use of TensorDataset, DataLoader and dimensions. I expect to fix it tomorrow

Day 5:
1. Continued work on Lesson 2 specifically the exercise from 2-1. Not going to lie, I got a little distracted because the MNIST dataset reminded me of an infamous cipher.
2. The MNIST dataset got me wondering if anyone has tried to solve the Zodiac Killers 340 cipher with machine learning and sure enough there was an interesting article:https://medium.com/@CanonManF22/defeat-the-zodiac-killer-with-machine-learning-trying-to-8404e21019c3
3. Currently researching why LSTM was used to try to solve the Zodiac Killers cipher when it is described as ""processing and making predictions on time series data"". :thinking_face:
Welcome @ndonowski! Encouraging you going into your Day 2! I hope you are enjoying all of this!@chidexfrancis4u  in your Day 6 post, I like how you mentioned errors in your code and working through them. That encouraged me because I make plenty of errors but its helping me learn. Good luck going into your Day 7 and beyond!!!Background:Reading time8 min read

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge. 
*Stay Udacious! :audacious_and_humble:*

Hi @mubashir.noman87,
I have advice for you,
1. you need to *post daily* for your update being counted as told by @akshit and Day 2,3,4,5 won't count it will only count for 1 day
2. try to Update different things daily as same update will not give you brownies
I hope you understand:60daysofudacitybadge:

1. Fixed mask-fetching part of code for Kaggle Pneumothorax Segmentation competition. Now masks (as well as corresponding x-ray images) are properly rendered as numpy arrays of size 1024 by 1024 pixels. Data processing code now complete with checks performed on select cases. https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/overview/
2. For the above Kaggle computer vision competition, found an algo called CheXNeXt started by a Stanford group which uses deep learning for chest radiograph diagnosis in general, including but not limited to pneumothorax: https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/chexnext/
3. Still brainstorming ideas about how to organize Hong Kong Hockey Association league competition data for solo federated learning project. Thinking about organizing results according to each team in the league, so as to enable predictions made on any given team when played against a specific opponent. So each team will have a dataset associated with it. This appears to be the simplest possible solution forward. But as a test case for this project, will start with some random model without the use of neural networks for the expected goals (xG) predictions, as this article outlines: https://towardsdatascience.com/o-jogo-bonito-predicting-the-premier-league-with-a-random-model-1b02fa3a7e5a
4. Found a relevant Kaggle chest x-ray dataset which may offer some more insights to our Kaggle pneumothorax detection group project. Will need to spend time to study the accompanying info for details: https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data
5. Reviewed some neural network concepts, including NN architecture, the feedforward and back-propagation mechanism involving the error function, and derived the algebraic form of the derivative of the sigmoid function by hand to consolidate learning.Identify Pneumothorax disease in chest x-raysDetecting Diseases from Chest X-Rays at the level of Radiologists.Spoiler: A little bit of randomness actually helps (and no, you don’t even need Machine learning)Reading time7 min readOver 112,000 Chest X-ray images from more than 30,000 unique patients

Day 1: I have completed Introducing Differential Privacy and Evaluating the privacy of a function already. Today, I took the pledge. I am struggling with Deep Learning with Pytorch. Tried grasping video 12 and 13 of this lesson. Was confused in neural networks so took help from Andrew NG and completed the following videos from his famous Machine Learning course and gave his quiz and got 80%. Learned how logic operators can be represented as neural networks.

Day 7 :: Started learning lesson 5:: Introducing local and global privacy.
Learnt below concepts::
The main strategy for preventing privacy is noise.We need to add random noise in database and in queries to protect individual privacy.
Two different types of differential privacy, which you can refer to two different places to add noise are::
1)Local differential privacy  2)Global differential privacy
Local differential privacy adds noise at each data function. Individual put noise to their own db before putting into database.
In this case, users are more protected as they dont have to trust data owner to protect their data.
Global differential privacy ::Trusted curator(Database owner) Adds noise to output of query in database.
Local Differential privacy :: Each user adds noise to the database, before sending it to statistical database.
Differential privacy always requires a form of randomness or noise added to the query to
protect from things like differencing attack.  Encouraging :: @srbharathee031, @ravisk1514 to join channel #60daysofudacity

Day 7! I’m nearly finished with Learning with PyTorch! Gonna be finishing it today or tomorrow, hopefully. Overall, I have already spent 3 hours today learning.
I also read a neat little article: https://phys.org/news/2019-07-artificial-intelligence.html
Hope you all are keeping up - especially you @alpeshyadav2518 and @himadri.tito13.From telecommunications to road traffic, from healthcare to the workplace—digital technology is now an intrinsic part of almost every area of life. Yet how can we ensure that developments in this field, especially those that rely on artificial intelligence (AI), meet all our ethical, legal and technological concerns? In a project led by the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems IAIS, and with the participation of Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), an interdisciplinary team of scientists from the Universities of Bonn and Cologne are drawing up an inspection catalog for the certification of AI applications. They have now published a white paper presenting the philosophical, ethical, legal and technological issues involved.

Day 6:
Apply document classification using predefined labels applying the word2vec Python module that I learned to use yesterday.
Milestones for today:
1. Use sigmoid activation function on vectors returned by word2vec that is thereby flattened for easy training.
2. Implement binary classification by thresholding > 0.5 for positive sentiment and <0.5 for negative sentiment.
3. Return result as probabilities and classes.
This is not really a good implementation of deep learning especially when I have a handful of segments as well as labels but this really got my hands dirty on things like word embeddings, tokenization, vectorization and padding.#60daysofudacity

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge.

Days 4:
• Read about differential privacy from https://robertovitillo.com/2016/07/29/differential-privacy-for-dummies/
• https://github.com/AceEviliano/Reading-Facebook-Secure-and-Private-AI-Scholarship/blob/master/Chapter%202%20-%20Part%20I.ipynbTechnology allows companies to collect more data and with more detail about their users than ever before. Sometimes that data is sold to third parties, other times it’s used to improve products and services.
In order to protect users’ privacy, anonymization techniques can be used to strip away any piece of personally identifiable data and let analysts access only what’s strictly necessary. As the Netflix competition in 2007 has shown though, that can go awry. The richness of data allows to identify users through a sometimes surprising combination of variables like the dates on which an individual watched certain movies. A simple join between an anonymized datasets and one of many publicly available, non-anonymized ones, can re-identify anonymized data.
Aggregated data is not much safer either under some circumstances! For example, say we have two summary statistics: one is the number of users, including Frank, that watch one movie per day and the other is the number of users, without Frank, that watch one movie per day. Then, by comparing the counts, we could tell if Frank watches one movie per day.
Differential Privacy to the rescue
Differential privacy formalizes the idea that a query should not reveal whether any one person is present in a dataset, much less what their data are. Imagine two otherwise identical datasets, one with your information in it, and one without it. Differential Privacy ensures that the probability that a query will produce a given result is nearly the same whether it’s conducted on the first or second dataset. The idea is that if an individual’s data doesn’t significantly affect the outcome of a query, then he might be OK in giving his information up as it is unlikely that the information would be tied back to him. The result of the query can damage an individual regardless of his presence in a dataset though. For example, if an analysis on a medical dataset finds a correlation between lung cancer and smoking, then the health insurance cost for a particular smoker might increase regardless of his presence in the study.
More formally, differential privacy requires that the probability of a query producing any given output changes by at most a multiplicative factor when a record (e.g. an individual) is added or removed from the input. The largest multiplicative factor quantifies the amount of privacy difference. This sounds harder than it actually is and the next sections will iterate on the concept with various examples, but first we need to define a few terms.
Dataset
We will think of a dataset  as being a collection of records from an universe . One way to represent a dataset  is with a histogram in which each entry  represents the number of elements in the dataset equal to . For example, say we collected data about coin flips of three individuals, then given the universe , our dataset  would have two entries:  and , where . Note that in reality a dataset is likely to be an ordered lists of rows (i.e. a table) but the former representation makes the math a tad easier.
Distance
Given the previous definition of dataset, we can define the distance between two datasets  with the  norm as:
Mechanism
A mechanism is an algorithm that takes as input a dataset and returns an output, so it can really be anything, like a number, a statistical model or some aggregate. Using the previous coin-flipping example, if mechanism  counts the number of individuals in the dataset, then . In practice though we will specifically considering randomized mechanisms, where the randomization is used to add privacy protection.
Differential Privacy
A mechanism  satisfies  differential privacy if for every pair of datasets  such that , and for every subset :
What’s important to understand is that the previous statement is just a definition. The  definition  is  not  an  algorithm,  but  merely  a  condition that must be satisfied by a mechanism to claim that it satisfies  differential privacy. Differential privacy allows researchers to use a common framework to study algorithms and compare their privacy guarantees.
Let’s check if our mechanism  satisfies  differential privacy. Can we find a counter-example for which:
is false? Given  such that  and , then:
i.e. , which is clearly false, hence this proves that mechanism  doesn’t satisfy  differential privacy.
Composition theorems
A powerful property of differential privacy is that mechanisms can easily be composed. These require the key assumption that the mechanisms operate independently given the data.
Let  be a dataset and  an arbitrary function. Then, the sequential composition theorem asserts that if  is  differentially private, then  is  differentially private. Intuitively this means that given an overall fixed privacy budget, the more mechanisms are applied to the same dataset, the more the available privacy budget for each individual mechanism will decrease.
The parallel composition theorem asserts that given  partitions of a dataset , if for an arbitrary partition ,  is  differentially private, then  is  differentially private. In other words, if a set of  differentially private mechanisms is applied to a set of disjoint subsets of a dataset, then the combined mechanism is still  differentially private.
The randomized response mechanism
The first mechanism we will look into is “randomized response”, a technique developed in the sixties by social scientists to collect data about embarrassing or illegal behavior. The study participants have to answer a yes-no question in secret using the following mechanism :
Flip a biased coin with probability of heads ;
If heads, then answer truthfully with ;
If tails, flip a coin with probability of heads  and answer “yes” for heads and “no” for tails.
In code:
def randomized_response_mechanism(d, alpha, beta):
if random()
Privacy is guaranteed by the noise added to the answers. For example, when the question refers to some illegal activity, answering “yes” is not incriminating as the answer occurs with a non-negligible probability whether or not it reflects reality, assuming  and  are tuned properly.
Let’s try to estimate the proportion  of participants that have answered “yes”. Each participant can be modeled with a Bernoulli variable  which takes a value of 0 for “no” and a value of 1 for “yes”. We know that:
Solving for  yields:
Given a sample of size , we can estimate  with .  Then, the estimate  of  is:
To determine how accurate our estimate is we will need to compute its standard deviation. Assuming the individual responses  are independent, and using basic properties of the variance,
By taking the square root of the variance we can determine the standard deviation of . It follows that the standard deviation  is proportional to , since the other factors are not dependent on the number of participants. Multiplying both  and  by  yields the estimate of the number of participants that answered “yes” and its relative accuracy expressed in number of participants, which is proportional to .
The next step is to determine the level of privacy that the randomized response method guarantees. Let’s pick an arbitrary participant. The dataset  is represented with either 0 or 1 depending on whether the participant answered truthfully with a “no” or “yes”. Let’s call the two possible configurations of the dataset respectively  and . We also know that  for any . All that’s left to do is to apply the definition of differential privacy to our randomized response mechanism :
The definition of differential privacy applies to all possible configurations of , e.g.:
The privacy parameter  can be tuned by varying . For example, it can be shown that the randomized response mechanism with  and  satisfies  differential p…`

Day 6:
Today I studied the implementation of validation testing during model training of a network to check for overfitting. I shared my code walkthrough on my GitHub acc to help with review later onhttps://github.com/festusdrakon/Udacity/blob/master/IntroToDeepLearningWithPyTorch/IntroToPyTorch/012_ImplementValidationPass.py
Thanks to @bharati.frnds for suggesting I systematically review for long term retention, and to @munniomer for suggesting I do it publicly
Felt pumped up upon learning that I'd won last week's quiz on the #wmn_who_code  channel :rumanu:
Discussed options for pursuing Master's programs in world class Institutes in India with @avi.seth8
Had productive discussions about studying Data Structures and Algorithms with @apoorva.k.patil and @sabihaabc1
Had a motivating discussion about learning new things for becoming Kaggle competition ready with my dearest  @krisastern
Thank you so much for motivating and guiding me towards getting ready for the real world of code, Kris! It would have been wayyy tougher to make that transition had I not had the honour of getting to work with you! :hero:
Got motivated by @indraneel.ghosh1998's commitment to the community initiatives and the #60DaysofUdacity program
Had a meet up with my study group @munniomer@aarthialagammai21@smogal95@apoorva.k.patil  to discuss doubts from the chapter Intro to Neural Networks from Udacity's Intro to DL with PyTorch Course
We also structured a timeline to work on beginner level projects around the basics such as Data Cleaning and basic algorithmic implementations of binary classification and regression

Thanking all those who encourage and motivate me during this course, with words, encouraging and motivating posts, you guys are awesome: tagging @ragnagus@labknr98@hawk.praxs533@alegalindo-101@electric.blakeBig changes are underway in the world of NLP. The long reign of word vectors as NLP's core representation technique has seen an exciting new line of challengers emerge. These approaches demonstrated that pretrained language models can achieve state-of-the-art results and herald a watershed moment.Written bySebastian RuderFiled undernatural language processing, transfer learning, language models

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.

[1] Evaluating The Privacy Of A Function using the iris data set.
[2] Working on projects [3, 4, 5 and 6] from Lesson 4: Evaluating the Privacy of a Function.
*What I learn:*
In this day, I implemented a function to calculate the sensitivity of the iris data set. Since we were working with a single feature, I evaluated the sensitivity of each feature using the sum query. I noticed how the sensitivity is affected for each feature when applying a simple sum operation. This is very interesting and shows how data can be susceptible when applying such operations.

Day 7: I decided my project to be an AI Scraper of HTML documents. More exactly order confirmations. I started by researching and learned that there are two main ways data extraction is done with deep learning algorithms: 1. By taking a screenshot of the document and using computer vision to identify the important elements or 2. By creating a DOM tree a la Beautiful soup and labeling the important tree nodes. But I didn't only do research I also started defining the sql database models with sqlalchemy. Whatever approach I finally decide on, I will definitely need those to define my train and test sets by pulling the data from the sql database. Stay hungry @ragnagus and @gogulaanand02!

2) Reviewed the Intro to Differential Privacy lesson.
3) Got answers to the questions:
*How is seed used in computation of the random values?*@workwithpurpose pointed to the Mersenne Twister, which is used to generate the pseudorandom numbers. Here is an overall description: https://www.cryptologie.net/article/331/how-does-the-mersennes-twister-work/ as well as a very detailed one: http://www.quadibloc.com/crypto/co4814.htm
*How to decide at which layer should the Dropout be inserted?*@nerytompz94 pointed out an important note: ""To use dropout, you can introduce it to all or some of the hidden layers in your neural network but you NEVER introduce dropout to your output layer because the purpose of the output layer is to classify and if the neurons disappear then it wouldnt perform the task."" and provided a very comprehensive article: https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5
4) Would like to encourage @oleks.litus and @zl108108 to join the #60daysofudacity club :party_parrot:Someone asked that question on reddit, and so I replied with a high level answer that should provide a clear enough view of the algorithm: From a high level, here's what a PRNG is supposed to look like: you start with a seed (if you re-use the same seed you will obtain the same random numbers), you initialize it into a state. Then, every time you want to obtain a random number, you transform that ...In this post, I will primarily discuss the concept of dropout in neural networks, specifically deep nets, followed by an experiment …Reading time4 min read

GOAL: To make a neural network designer. You design your PyTorch neural network using GUI with 0 code knowledge.
RESULTS: Well, so far I am moving slowly. There was not ready to use workflow for this kind of task. So I used RecycleView and reinventing the wheel at the moment.

DAY 6:
MUNCHING ON PYTORCH SOURCE
AND DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY AND LOVING IT
---------------------------
1. Still Tinkering with Tensors in Python and loving it.......Sometime in the future, we might have to implement a small neural network from the scratch, if the resources to run powerful libraries are not available.
2. I had my daily bite of Differential Privacy.
3. To wrap up today, I implemented a spontaneous Matrix class that does simple things,
convert a list of lists into a matrix, get its shape, describe it, and display it like a matrix without commas.
Link to demo notebook here https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/analytics/notebooks/v2/da9f4b3c-fb6a-4f4c-8765-8fb9e6de3759/view?access_token=90aff730198947bdc47a4c3d327e94d086b1d9a1abe29c3f03c0a02a3fc8f64a

Day 7:
1. I updated my #60daysofudacity project in github: https://github.com/users/rick1612/projects/1
2. I finished lesson 5.5 completely and understood the concepts deeply. Repository: https://github.com/rick1612/SecureAI-Course-Intro-to-Dif-Privacy/blob/master/Section%201%20-%20Differential%20Privacy.ipynb
3. I updated my notes for the course https://github.com/rick1612/SecureAI-Course-Intro-to-Dif-Privacy-Summary/blob/master/README.md
4. Today I met with a group of enthusiasts to work in a deep learning project. We took 3 options, and in this week we will see the viability of each one.
5.Thanks for the tag @pabloczul I join your initiative and encourange myself  :flag-co: @szeag198@davidblanco103@alejandro.aristizabal@djconrado
PD: A collateral effect of the 60daysofodacity is that I feel more confident to solve coding problems, I am getting the habit for that.

Hey Guys, Just joined today in this group.
I have been doing the lessons for few weeks now..
Day 1 of 60
1)	Revised previous lessons on deep learning with pytorch
2)	In progress with lesson differential privacy
3)	I have done some google research on differential privacy techniques, There are interesting papers that i came across.Here is a link to article that i came across.... https://medium.com/georgian-impact-blog/a-brief-introduction-to-differential-privacy-eacf8722283b

Stardate 72968.3 
1. Geeked out at work as I was finally allowed to install Visual Studio Enterprise. I'm an IT Engineer and  not really allowed to build at the moment so this is thrilling for me. I finally get to showcase my beginner developer skills I've been working on.
2. Working on Lesson 2, 2-2. I'm learning by trying things and then comparing it to the solution. I have been kind of code reviewing the solutions and keeping notes for my understanding.@a.eissa220 Welcome to 60days! Hope to see you post Day 2 and beyond!@bonn0062 What is Saturn Cloud? I love space so all these names for everything is awesome!  Congrats on Day 4, keep going! I'm a beginner but I'm here for you if you need anything!

1. Finally succeeded in training my own PPO agent! It took more than a week.. My reference code used only 2 actions, but I used full 6actions.
I think this additional actions made learning much harder..
My main trick was this. First, train agent with short horizon trajectories and extend it as agent matures. It’s easier to learn optimal actions with few frames than many frames. Second, I used decaying entropy loss term. Entropy encourages more exploration which is critical to first phase learning.
In conclusion, it is importnant to regularize learning during the early phase of training with fewer frames and high exploration terms.

1. Studied further into the research literature into thoracic disease classification for the Kaggle Pneumothorax Segmentation competition. Project group has some consensus regarding which model to implement, but more work needs to be done in order to glean info about this very effective algo (with a ~94% diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of a trained radiologist) by a Stanford group which is not yet in the public domain. Also found is a similar work by a rival group using some Google AI algo. Will need to design the NN architecture for the deep learning part of this computer vision project. But reckon we could simplify the problem into a binary classification one with the Google Cloud Healthcare API pneunothorax dataset designated for the contest. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation)
2. Reviewed convolutional neural network (CNN) concepts and applications. Walked through how to implement the famous MNIST dataset with PyTorch again today in this regard.
3. Reviewed loss related concepts such as the cross-entropy loss. Recalled that the cross-entropy loss class can be broken down into first the softmax and then the negative log likelihood loss in PyTorch, so that I can get the class probabilities as well as the class scores.

*Day 3:*02/07/2019
• Performed digit recognition using a neural network on the MNIST dataset using Keras library.
• Trained the model on the GPU.
------------------------------
*Day 4:*03/07/2019
• On the same MNIST dataset, used a fully connected neural network.
• Used fit_generator() function [from Keras library] to perform real-time data augmentation on images on CPU in parallel to training the model on GPU.
• Data augmentation: rotation, width shift, height shift, shear, and zoom.
• It took more time to train the model using fit_generator() function (because it uses CPU).
------------------------------
*Day 5:*04/07/2019
• Used a convolutional neural network with Convolutional, MaxPooling, Flatten and Dense layers.
• Trained the model without the data augmentation on MNIST dataset.

- Wanted to check implementation of Federated Learning, so looked up codes for that.
- Federated Learning deployed by SAP in Germany, found in Github, so looked details in each python codes, and followed each line of logic to figure out general purpose of the program.

*Day 08: #60daysofudacity *
• After completing the hypothetical offline small db and going through the Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory, i'm able to picture the entire concept differential privacy which i've learned in this course till now. Really to thank Cynthia Dwork for his amazing work.
Here is an example of how beautiful it is: https://towardsdatascience.com/measuring-the-power-of-a-classifier-c765a7446c1c
• Got an in-depth understanding on boosting a classifier.
• Working on the accuracy of flower classifier and prototyping.
• Completed pointer chain function and moving to the encrypted deep learning now.
Thanks udacity for providing bonus interviews.
Abhishek bhowmick just blown up my mind!
Today's quote is dedicated to Vladimir vapnik for his amazing work on statistical classification and learning rate.

Day 7:
1. Utilize CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text to generate tokens of unigrams and bigrams easily that can be fed into the model.
2. Understand the intuition behind interaction terms in document classification where n-grams are not adjacent and still conveys the same thought.
Interaction terms mathematically describe words that are next to each other.
\beta_1x_1 + \beta _2x_2 + \beta_3(x_1*x_2)
Here, x1 and x2 tells whether tokens appear or not in a row. Beta1 and Beta2 determine token importance. We add another computation of how important these tokens when appeared together via the third term.
I only used scikit-learn for this purpose (ie. PolynomialFeatures and SparseMatrix) but this is enough for me to be familiarized with the intuition behind interaction terms. Hoping for the best in the upcoming projects.#60daysofudacity
PS. I tried LaTeX in formula but obviously, it does not work. Shout out to @ragnagus for giving me the heads up.

*I am happy to announce a visual neural network designer based on PyTorch called Rabbit.*https://github.com/andreiliphd/rabbit-visual-neural-network-designer-pytorch
FAQ:
Is it tested thoroughly?
The answer is no.
Is it working?
Yes
Can I contribute?
You are very welcome to contribute and test.
What do you want us to do?
Evaluate my idea and star my repo on Github.
How long did it take to write Rabbit?
Two days including my Kivy educational time.
Why did you call it Rabbit?
Well, I wrote a Snake repo yesterday based on tkinter. Today is a Rabbit on Kivy. Much more functional.
What kind of task are supported?
Image classification tasks. But I can make it work with text or sound or whatever you want. I just need time.
How can I use your app?
- for education
- for prototyping
Great! What else?

Day 8:: Studying/practicing the lesson 5 ""Local Differential Privacy""
Local DP::In local DP, everything added to database is already protected.The protection is happening at local level.
How much noise should we add?? DP always requires a form of randomness or noise added to the query to protect from things like
Differencing attack.
eg :: You wanted to study how many people have committed suicide ..you will do jaywalking.
There is chance that each person will answer dishonestly.There is technique that some randomness can be added so that
each person response is protected with plausible deniability.
Trying to get the understanding for below code or point::
So since 70 percent of people actually jaywalk,
this means that roughly half our participants will say yes or no with a 50 percent probability
and the other will say yes or no with a 70 percent probability.
Thus when we average these two together, the results of our survey will be 60 percent.                                                                                                                                       Encouraging @ahmad.eissa1000 and @nic.dinkins to join channel(60dayUdacity)

- Organised and attended Mumbai Meetup to have amazing discussions with fellow scholars
![image7](https://github.com/Polarbeargo/Secure-Private-AI-Facebook-Scholarship-KeyStone-project/blob/master/images/Meetuppic1.jpg)
**$Summarized all ideas and initiatives as outcome of today's meetup$**
**SPAIC Mumbai Meetup - 29-06-19**
**Local Meetup**
To be planned every two/three weeks
5 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Location should be such that we can have technical discussion as well as host virtual meetup for members who cannot join personally (we faced this issue today)
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc
**Virtual meetup**
To be planned every  week
3 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc
**Trello board for all mumbai meetup activities**
We are planning to create a trello board for listing for task done by mumbai Members as there is no specific channel. This may help us to be aware of all activities at one place and we can share screenshot of this list in 60dayofudacity
**Study buddy groups**
Idea is to start study buddy group for all mumbai members which will help all of us with course completion, learning and participate in this challenge actively.
2 members from mumbai can pair up with each other and search 2 members from slack (who are not in mumbai) for studying together.
Apart from course lessons, they could get involved in some project, activities/topic discussion/sessions that can be shared during mumbai meetups (Definitely we will have only mumbai members for local meetups so they can share their work as a representative from their group).
Each group task/initiative will be managed using trello boards so that others can give suggestions or join any task they are interested into.
**Initiatives**
Apart from the above activities, it would be good if we take part in slack initiatives already in progress or new initiatives we can think during meetup or slack channel to have a better learning and been active.
**Above initiatives are just a suggestion and we would need your input/feedback/ideas from all of you.**

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge. 
*Stay Udacious! :audacious_and_humble:*

 *DAY 7 of 60: July 4, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 91%. I'm in *Lesson 9 - Encrypted Deep Learning* (11% completed). The Lesson 8 on *Securing Federated Learning* was really interesting. I always wanted to know about distributing sharings and the trick with large prime numbers. Thank Udacity so much. I'm really happy. I talked to 3 classmates from Latin America (@preriec, @ragnagus, and @spideykk) in order to create our own Study Group for Hispanic people. I asked to #ama_sessions a question about private messages, Study-Groups, and their channels: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJF1DQDEW/p1562265842273700 Today, I will meet a potential client who wants to hire me to build a deep learning system capable of analyzing the facial emotions of potential employees in the videos of job interviews. I will propose 2 approaches: One approach with only convnets and transfer learning with VGG16. And another approach with RNNs, convnets, and transfer learning with VGG16. RNNs are supposed to disambiguate patterns by analyzing context. I will also propose to analyze the emotions in their voices, not only their faces. I'm deeply thankful to Udacity for teaching me all these concepts in the previous PyTorch Facebook scholarship. I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @christian_tutiven, @gstavocevallos, @ssalvatierra777, and @ruben.romo.gonzalez to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity. I will continue watching the lectures of the nanodegree and programming the associated Jupyter notebooks.

Anyway, *Day 1*:
• Explained a student in AI Python the concepts of order and why python dictionaries are unordered
• Assisted another student in resubmitting a self created image classifier which differentiates between hundreds of different plant species
• Listened to an older TwimlAI Podcast about productizing Ml at Twitter

Day 8
1. I am still working on group project with @arkachkrbrty@manishajhunjhunwala7@mudeledimeji :clapping:
It's really a challenging dataset.. @arkachkrbrty and I had an accuracy barrier  on arround 6162% ( about 200 epochs for me ) . So after the released krakens  ( unfreeze everything in the model ) we accomblished 7782%. We are using different models and optimizers... For me it's a little bit harder  because I am using SGD... I need more epochs for better results...
We have already planned how can we push for 90%...
Note: The  top models (from papers) for this dataset is 88% - 90%  ( with the Heavy models and servers )...  We decided to use light model because we want a heroku deployment..
We have a small breakthrough already and I am super happy 
2 . I updated my yesterday model on kaggle with the inceptionV3 on MNIST.. it's still on commit state :thinking_face:
3. I was patient with kaggle....  they refused the gpu support  3-4 times today... I counted 2 times yesterday
4. Studied about our group project dataset more than 5 papers
5. @arkachkrbrty@ash3ax@mudeledimeji@prakhar.tripathi2205@manishajhunjhunwala7

""Intuitively, we want to be able to query our database and evaluate whether or not the result of the query is leaking \""private\"" information. As mentioned previously, this is about evaluating whether the output of a query changes when we remove someone from the database. Specifically, we want to evaluate the *maximum* amount the query changes when someone is removed (maximum over all possible people who could be removed). So, in order to evaluate how much privacy is leaked, we're going to iterate over each person in the database and measure the difference in the output of the q…

Day 8: I am spending 2 hours watching MIT lectures on Machine Learning. Then I am going to finish up Learning with PyTorch and move on to the next lesson! I read a neat article today, too: https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-machine-learning-algorithms-uncover-hidden-scientific.html
I hope you guys are keeping up with everything! @jcchidiadi and @gruza.agata - have you posted today’s bit?Sure, computers can be used to play grandmaster-level chess (chess_computer), but can they make scientific discoveries? Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) have shown that an algorithm with no training in materials science can scan the text of millions of papers and uncover new scientific knowledge.

ENDING MY 'TENSORIFIC' WEEK WITH
A FULLY FUNCTIONAL VECTOR LIBRARY
--------------------------------------
1. In sync with the order of the course, I dedicated this first seven days to extensive TENSOR tinkering.
Happy to bring it to an end with my first, out of several which are yet to come, SPAIC 60DAYSOFUDACITY projects.
Today, vectokit passed through extensive testing and launched, confidently, for use.
Gladly, you can do live interactive vector arithmetic in your shell just by $ vectorkit.
2. I had my daily bite of Differential Privacy, as usual.
3. Provided help to colleagues here in SPAIC slack.
4. Prepping for my priorities and next project for the coming week.

Revisiting Federated Learning with a look at some research that aims to implement it with the explicit intention of forcing a differentially private mechanism. Uses a combination of random subsampling of the updated weights followed by distorting their average with Gaussian noise. Let’s see if I can get this working with a toy dataset and maybe even an MNIST classifier

Milestones:
1. Review how PyTorch builds tensors, preserve historical computations and handle backpropagation by accumulating gradients using the backward functions.
2. Explore computational graphs specifically autograd functions in PyTorch
Notes:
In deep learning frameworks such as Keras, computational graphs are fixed. Understandable since it has a direct analog to sklearn with respect to pipelines.
With PyTorch, computational graphs can be updated on the fly without rebuilding the model by implementing autograd.Variable which significantly adds flexibility when racking down tensor changes through functional operations.#60daysofudacity

*#60daysofudacity Day 9*
1. Started working on code for the chest x-ray image segmentation part of the Kaggle Pneumothorax Segmentation competition.
2. Discussed with Kaggle group about directions moving forward, and has agreed on a literature review process over the weekend to digest relevant research findings regarding pneumothorax detection with deep learning. Agreed that some sort of a CNN architecture to be implemented as we would like to preserve 2D structure in the data to be fed to the DL model for the diagnostic part of the project.
3. Found more useful references for the Kaggle project, including a recent (2019) paper published in a Nature periodical.
4. Reviewed concepts in both multilayer-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN), and digesting their differences.
5. Revisited how to apply an MLP model on the MNIST data, with the help of a validation set for model validation to minimize impact of either overfitting (error due to variance) and underfitting (error due to bias). This serves to me as a good review of the bias-variance tradeoff in fitting a set of training data.

Learned that how Chain rule is a powerful tool. Back propagation is just merely a tool to calculate the derivative of error with respect to weights for gradient descent. Correspondingly, gradient descent resulting in updating weights such that it minimizes the error.#60daysofudacity

- Organised and attended Mumbai Meetup to have amazing discussions with fellow scholars
![image7](https://github.com/Polarbeargo/Secure-Private-AI-Facebook-Scholarship-KeyStone-project/blob/master/images/Meetuppic1.jpg)
**$Summarized all ideas and initiatives as outcome of today's meetup$**
**SPAIC Mumbai Meetup - 29-06-19**
**Local Meetup**
To be planned every two/three weeks
5 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Location should be such that we can have technical discussion as well as host virtual meetup for members who cannot join personally (we faced this issue today)
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc
**Virtual meetup**
To be planned every  week
3 members from Mumbai could join for organizing this activity
Time, location, agenda, activities to be decided for each meetup
Organiser could conduct activities and agenda could be like discussion on one topic from course, recent initiatives by members, time based fun games related to course,etc
**Trello board for all mumbai meetup activities**
We are planning to create a trello board for listing for task done by mumbai Members as there is no specific channel. This may help us to be aware of all activities at one place and we can share screenshot of this list in 60dayofudacity
**Study buddy groups**
Idea is to start study buddy group for all mumbai members which will help all of us with course completion, learning and participate in this challenge actively.
2 members from mumbai can pair up with each other and search 2 members from slack (who are not in mumbai) for studying together.
Apart from course lessons, they could get involved in some project, activities/topic discussion/sessions that can be shared during mumbai meetups (Definitely we will have only mumbai members for local meetups so they can share their work as a representative from their group).
Each group task/initiative will be managed using trello boards so that others can give suggestions or join any task they are interested into.
**Initiatives**
Apart from the above activities, it would be good if we take part in slack initiatives already in progress or new initiatives we can think during meetup or slack channel to have a better learning and been active.
**Above initiatives are just a suggestion and we would need your input/feedback/ideas from all of you.**

(SIMULATING SPAIC'S PROGRESSION)
--------------------------------------------
1. Tinkered with PyTorch. Twisting and turning some of its
functionality.
2. Played with some core cyptography concepts. Prepping for
Encrypted Deep Learning.
3. @shaam.al.shayah.93, exposed me to an interesting image analysis feat.
We had to write code to check the correlation
between several images. Looks like the beginning of something interesting .
We are still experimenting with it.

I have a problem that I am not sure how to solve.
So I have images and they are split into several classes labeled from 1 to 6.
And my supervisor wants to see how the images are correlated to each other.
I know there is a function called corr() where you through a csv file of usually tabular data, but I am not sure how I can do it for images. Please do not tell me about correlating two images, this I know, I want to find the correlation between several images (or the several classes of the images).
Any idea how I can do that?

I encourage @akarhade5@ma3359 to take part in this challengeThis post presents WaveNet, a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms. We show that WaveNets are able to generate speech which mimics any human voice and which sounds more natural than the best existing Text-to-Speech systems, reducing the gap with human performance by over 50%. We also demonstrate that the same network can be used to synthesize other audio signals such as music, and present some striking samples of automatically generated piano pieces.

Day 6
Still in transfer learning and I want to see the significance of more hidden layers.
Current summary update
1. The processing time for one to five hidden layers are quite similar, no significance differences. I would like to test using 10 hidden layers tomorrow, in addition to test with resnet101 pre trained algorithm.
2. Interesting part is with accuracy. Increasing hidden layer from one to two will increase the accuracy quicker but adding hidden layer to 3, 4, 5 will drop the accuracies for the same iteration.
3. I only used 1 epoch, tomorrow I would like to test using several epoch and diiference batch size. I want to see the differences.

Day 9: Intro to DL with Pytorch(ud188) - Completed Lesson 2
1. Why to optimize?
2. Overfitting and underfitting
Early stopping - Stop learning(training) when the testing loss starts to increase
Regularization - Penalizing larger weights to avoid complex models
Dropout - Not using some nodes in each training epoch and hence ensuring each node gets trained equally
3. Vanishing Gradients
Use better activation function
4. Local Minima
Random Restart - Try initializing weights with different random values
5. Batch and Stochastic GD
Instead of using all the data points in each training step, use a number of subsets and train
6. Learning rate
Momentum - Move in the weighted average direction of previous gradients, with more weightage given to the more recent gradients Neural Networks and Deep Learning(deeplearning.ai)
1. Gradient descent on Logistic Regression
2. Coding gradient descent for logistic regression and vectorization
Using two for loops
Using one for loop
Fully vectorized logistic regression
3. Logistic loss proof
4. Quiz Neural network basics (10/10)

Day9 done 
Day 9: Completed #l7_sec_federtd_learn WOOHOO!
Here are some of the exciting things that I learned (Might be helpful after watching the videos for a quick recap)
- To perform federated learning to train your model, gradient accumulation is essential. However, the said accumulation by the trusted owner could compromise privacy. So we introduce third secure aggregator.
- Even though we distribute the information (i.e. the model) to various participants, some leaks can still be exploited.
- To avoid such leaks, the distribution can be tied together with basic prime number encryption. The decryption, of course, by prime number factorization (SHOR'S ALGORITHM), still stands a chance to be done by a quantum computer but that is overlooked in this course.
- Prime numbers have a problem. They are integers, not decimals. However, our weights and all the other data on the hand is floating point. This can be overcome by an encoding method, fixed precision encoding, which converts the decimals into integers, by multiplying with a factor of 10 that you care about.
- Combine all of this is what makes the system secure and ready for deployment. Project on our project t-shirt continues. Thanks to @ltruncel, we have a study group now! Shout out to all the teammates @ewotawa, @sfmajors373, @tsmedia.rj, @ltruncel, @krts18199

Heyyyyy @vimaayi  thanks a lot for mentioning me here, this means a lot to me. So as a feedback: I did feature extraction using densenet121 (used it as pre-trained model), then those feature vectors I put in a data frame with the corresponding labels.
And interestingly I get the attached image (for all images —> this us why it is hard to see the little labels on top and left the correlation matrix). So I thought what do not I take the mean of all the images‘ feature vectors of each class to be able to represent the 6 classes, and what is interesting is that now I draw the correlation matrix and it is giving me NANs  no idea why (shown in screenshot)
Soooooo lets collaborate again and find out why :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:

There are over 70,000 images, including kids who sometimes you can't tell the gender. So I will just try with this other dataset .If you know of a better one, please share with me.
Thanks

@pogayo17 nope it’s not the number that counts try to take a smaller dataset and label it yourself if you can. Or use webscraper and get data from google or bing or yahoo just clean the data well.Did you try kaggle?

Day 9
1. I am still working on group project with @arkachkrbrty@mudeledimeji@manishajhunjhunwala7@ash3ax@prakhar.tripathi2205
We managed to have a stable 81~82% accuracy on validation test already...
some results
The stable oneEpoch 6/15..     Running Loss: 0.7820..      Test Loss: 0.7258     Test Accuracy: 0.81725
** Validation loss decreased (0.732682 --> 0.725803).  Saving model ...

the highest accuracy for my model...Epoch 15/15..     Running Loss: 0.7136..      Test Loss: 0.7329     Test Accuracy: 0.82066

For validation test I used the highest accuracy modelTest Loss: 0.764917
Test Accuracy (Overall): 81.386139% (7398/9090)

I am preparing my final pushs with the 100% of the training data and a heavy mix of augmentantions ...
The results above are with the 90% of my training data (not ALL the dataset )... I am using the 700/200/100 images per class
We found some good ways to prevent the overfitting 
2. I commited a private kernel for  blood-cell-classification... ( the commit is still in progress :face_with_rolling_eyes: )
3. I made a small improvement and I have my results from the InceptionV3 on FMNIST...  ( yeah I can improve it.. I am absorbed with the group project.. )
4. I  started a funny dataset https://www.kaggle.com/cdawn1/messy-vs-clean-room
5. Studied on the researchers section about the new models (pytorch hub)
6.  Our group finally was selected 
7.  Our core started to plan for our group members the nexts projects

Day 8: I continued working on lesson 6 and started the final project for the lesson. It is amazing that this time we get the chance to combine both DL models with differential privacy! I am making a summary of topics I want to learn in parallel in order to read extensively Cynthia Dwork’s book. There is a lot of math involved in the proofs and for me those theoretical results are incredibly important in order to pursue a life as a researcher and not just a “black box expert”. Planning is essential, so it took me quite of a time today. I am really happy that now we got a Latin American group #sg_latin (I had to make some publicity here, haha), I hope we can make some projects together that allow us in the future to give some value to our societies 
Big thanks to @ash3ax, @preriec, @chan_way, @garg4.ag, @anvillasoto, and specially to @sfmajors373 and @labknr98 for their encouragement and their piece of light and good energy yesterday

I am so pumped to be back and learn as much as I can! I just learned about the 60daysofudacity last night and I absolutely love it! What a brilliant idea! Here is what I have completed today:
1) Accepted the challenge
2) Watched all the videos on “Deep Learning with Pytorch” and took notes
3) Finished Part 2 - Neural Networks in PyTorch (Exercises)
4) Learned about the techniques to build a recommender system from Machine Learning Foundations course by University of Washington
5) I’d like to encourage@aakankshadhurandhar34@ahmedthabit99@abdoayman@jaikirao1 to continue participating in this challenge.
Yesterday, I decided to skim through all the lessons to see what’s waiting for me to learn to get myself excited. So it marked all the lessons as completed.

[1] Beginning with Lesson 5: Introducing Local and Global Differential Privacy [videos 1 – 4].
[2] Reading section 2:  [page: 11 – 15] from the Book The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy.
*What I learn:*
I learn about two types of privacy, which are local and global privacy. In the first method, the data is altered with some type of noise. This method guarantees more protection for the users, since the data itself is been altered. On the other hand, in global privacy, the noise is added to the output of the query, instead of the data itself as with local privacy. From this context I think, that in some scenarios, global privacy could be more effective, since local privacy has an inherent resource cost.

- *Hyperparameters* and why we need to set them before running our algorithms
- The *building blocks of the learning algorithms*. Each learning algorithm should have: (loss function, optimization criterion and optimization routine(In our course we implemented gradient decent as an optimization criterion but I am not sure if we have covered the optimization routine))
- There is a section covering *gradient decent* and how to implement it using python code (I haven't finished it yet)

 *DAY 8 of 60: July 5, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar My overall progress in this nanodegree is now 100%. I just finished my last lesson: *Lesson 10 - Challenge Course Wrap up*. The Lesson 9 on *Encrypted Deep Learning* was well taught. Encrypted Deep Learning is an awesome technology. I didn't know that frameworks such as OpenMined and Syft existed today. Thank Udacity so much for educating us. I noticed that *Lesson 10 - Challenge Course Wrap up* does not have a final project common to all of us, like the final project of the previous *PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook*. The final project will be rather a personal project to be developed, documented, and posted on Slack in the corresponding channels. From now on, I will focus on developing and documenting my final project. Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics*. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was 1 intense hour of writing answers. Thank @ikhushpatel for your encouraging words. We, people from Ecuador, are really happy to see that our Study Group #sg_ecuador was created. People from Ecuador are invited to join us. Now we will use our own public channel #sg_ecuador instead of sending private messages. I also joined 2 Study Groups from Latin America: #sg_hispanic and #sg_latin. I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @christian_tutiven, @gstavocevallos, @ssalvatierra777, and @ruben.romo.gonzalez to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.

Btw, if you want to learn together about maths, let me know. I think that will be more motivating and beneficial for both of us Learn Mathematics for Machine Learning from Imperial College London. For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in ...Using Python, learn statistical and probabilistic approaches to understand and gain insights from data.

@labknr98 I have completed Mathematics specialization from Coursera.

• Finished chapter number four of ""The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy"". It was quite an awesome journey till now. At Least now i know what's going on behind private multiplicative weights algorithm and its dependencies on several parameters.
• After getting some time from my app, i turned back to the ""Intro to pytorch with deep learning course"" and almost completed convolution neural networks and the videos which were left behind.
""Interview with soumith was the best thing i've came across on that course. I'm all fired up now!!""
• Still fighting with some bugs on my kaggle submission, since my architecture was overfitting things. Decided to take another approach!
• Joined #sg_novice-ai and yup! we are looking for some awesome people to join our extra enthusiastic members and help them to get started with the code!

[1] Continuing with Lesson 5 [videos 5 – 7].
[2] Working on the Project: Implement Local Differential Privacy
*What I learn:*
Today I learn about two types of noise, which can be added in global privacy: Gaussian and Laplacian. From this type of noises, at the time, the Laplacian noise is more widely used, due to its relative easy calculation. Also, the formal definition of privacy implement two important factors: epsilon and delta. The former measures the difference in distributions from the original data and the data with missing entries. Meanwhile, delta represent the probability of leaking extra information. For that reason, the usual values to delta are very tiny or zero.

Day 9:
Milestones:
1. Explored dimensionality reduction techniques on datasets with too many features.
2. Read paper about Akaike Information Criterion, Bayesian Information Criterion and Mallows Cp in determining the best model using step function.
Notes:
I am interested in reducing model complexity by reducing the amount of features to be fed into deep learning model without sacrificing interpretability. In statistics like R squared, it may seem that the model is performing well but the truth is it just accounts for redundant covariates increasing the variance of the variance estimate.
I don't want to use PCA since that will definitely becomes uninterpretable. With step-wise model building, we can easily determine components that best describe the data by calculating AIC per model iteration. That is, 2number_of_predictors - 2ln(sum_of_squared_errors).

*#60daysofudacity Day 10*
1. Our small study buddy group with @fridarode00 called ""Datasyfters"" has been selected and given a channel on Slack at #sg_datasyfters ! Today we discussed how to theme our studies based around our decidedly slow-paced participation in the Kaggle Blindness Detection competition. (With much research into the existing literature to follow.) We reasoned that collaborating on a Computer Vision project like this could be challenging while fruitful. so that we could learn from each other. We are determined to use PyTorch at all cost on such an endeavor: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection
2. Reviewed on some Convolutional Neural Network concepts. The most notable of which is how to use Capsule Networks as an alternative to Pooling in order to preserve more of the features in an image or 2D matrix while training the CNN model. This will be crucial for me in undertaking my other Kaggle group project on Pneumothorax Segmentation.
3. Still brainstorming the organization structure of the local hockey league data from HKHA to be used for private-ai project. Will try out some hands-on stuff next.
Would like to encourage @fridarode00, @indraneel.ghosh1998, @rumanubhardwaj, @ash3ax and @susyjame to rock on and continue in our journey until the completion of this Challenge!Detect diabetic retinopathy to stop blindness before it's too late

Hi @fridarode00 for object detection and instance segmentation models, it works fine as of now. I'm still analyzing some issues that it still didn't catch some false positives in pneumothorax. For open images, I'm still having an issue on incorrect flipping of some bounding boxes.

Day 9:
1. Had an hour and a half long meetup to discuss course lessons, clear off doubts and project ideas. We had some intriguing conversations about sensitivity while training DL models on MNIST, how to effectively use data loaders to avoid loading entire data at once, how to use differential privacy in regression models, and the cons of differential privacy.
Tagging: all participants:@shivamraisharma@nabhu123@alegalindo-101@drcjudelhi@alegalindo-101@0107wy@r.pretelt16@ingusterbets@vincivenv@sadmibouhafs@souvikb1812@f2014360

Day 7: Transfer Learning - Impact of the number of hidden layers 3
I am still evaluating the number of hidden layers. It seemed either I measure it wrongly or I am using wrong parameter. I cannot get the expected result where the training processing time is higher for additional hidden layer.

The results were all of them had similar processing time.https://60daysofudacity.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-7-transfer-learning-impact-of.htmlStill looking on how to measure the impact of increasing the number of hidden layers on training.

Day 4
OMG I did it with Pytorch!  Lalalala. Previously, few months ago I had learnt to train neural networks using Tensorflow but I hadn't try to go in-depth then. Now when I understand much of the concepts and its maths and how pytorch has made them easier to work with, I understand the power of neural networks.
What I did today:
- Watched an hour+ long lecture on back propagation, as suggested by udacity course mate @aniketthomas27, not to forget many other lectures, I have been trying to grasp about back propagation lately. https://www.youtube.com/watch…
- Revised video 12 and 13 of Lesson 2 i.e Intro to Pytorch, which were sounding alien before and got amazed that how after coming back to the same lecture after few days, meanwhile youtubing and googling about Back propagation, loss functions and gradient descent, strengthened my concepts and I easily learned the concepts of video 12 and 13 without pausing in between.
- Finally, attempted the following exercise.#60daysofudacity

Day 10
Making analog of TensorBoard for PyTorch with much deeper analysis including gradients. There is a lot of work. At the moment I stopped on Dash Python web framework which is tailored for data analysis. I want to store data from PyTorch in MySql database. There are questions:
1) What database is best suited for storing PyTorch tensors?
2) What is the best schema for the database? I am not really a DB designer although I know fundamental concepts.
3) Is DB is the best way to communicate with two Python apps? I thought about multiprocessing and exchanging data between two processes but it looks hairy. TensorFlow exchanging model through file does not really satisfy me.

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge. 
*Stay Udacious! :audacious_and_humble:*

Day 10 :july 6th worked on efficient net resnet comaparison. Efficientnet is amazing as it provides reasonable accuracy with lesser model parameters using compound scaling(single parameter to control scaling of height width and depth)

Thank you @learn556, I went through the resource and the knowledge is worth adding to our stack. It was a useful resource. I was concerned about time complexities in our implementation and this solves that in a different way. But our scenario requires a correlation, which we have had reason to believe is not just matching. That was our headache, so we had to do some number sifting and get arrays(not multidimensional arrays) for each image and we could run correlation...I am quite amzed at what we have to do myself . Thank you for sharing the resource.

Hey there again, I am very happy to tell you that I figured it out 
There was a column with so many zeros which makes the variance and the standard deviation =0 then somewhere in the math things lead to Nans. So I had to check why this one column had zeros and it was a small mistake I made in my calculations, so fixing that made everything work again!!

Day 10. Formal definition of differential privacy in Lesson 5. Studied not just from the course lecture but from various other source. Here's my attempt to explain to a fellow classmate, as I've understood it: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJW72L5D2/p1562445468477800?thread_ts=1562436478.466900&cid=CJW72L5D2@aisha.jv70 I'll give it a go. This explanation is based on learning about it from various other sources.
Why do we care about differential privacy? Well, to protect the ""privacy"" of individuals who will share their data. You probably knew this, but this was just for the sake of completeness.
Okay, but that is so vague. How do you do it? And, how would you know if you actually ""protected privacy""? Hmm, we do it by introducing a random algorithm or a noise component (the coin flip exercise). As to how we would know, *that's what the formal definition tries to quantify.*
So, what do we really mean when we mention ""protecting privacy""? We mean that someone who is using the data of the users to perform some study should not be able to learn anything about a particular individual in that database (and this applies to every individual). In other words, when we query the database, the output of the query should be the same if I remove an individual from a database.
Say, for example I am studying drug addiction across various age groups. So, I have a database x of people in the ages 20-60. I divide the individuals into four groups 20-30, 30-40, 40-50 and 50-60 and get a count of addicts and non-addicts in each group. In other words, I can now estimate probabilities of a person being an addict in a particular age group. What I know have is a probability distribution. This is the Pr[M(x)] term in the inequality.
Now, coming over to privacy. Let's say I have a person named John Doe in my database. Privacy entails that I shouldn't be able to figure out if John is an addict. In other words, if I were to create a database y from x such that John wasn't in it but the rest of the people were (||x - y|| <= 1), then the distribution of drug addicts across various age groups that I calculate now, with John removed (which is the Pr[M(y)] term), should be similar to Pr[M(x)].
But how you quantify similarity? You do it by introducing epsilon and delta. So, let's say that Pr[M(x)] was [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2] and after removing John, Pr[M(y)] was [0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2] (I know what you're thinking, how could it change this drastically ). So, to satisfy the equation Pr[M(x)] <= exp(epsilon) Pr[M(y)] + delta, we would need a value of 0.69 for epsilon and 0 for delta. Therefore, we can now say that our procedure M (which is responsible for keeping things private by introducing randomness) is (0.69, 0)-differentially private. Are those good values? We don't know. But now that we have a method to calculate those values for different M's, we can study a bunch of them to determine if M1 is better or worse than M2. That's what the definition is for. To be able to study the effectiveness of different M's.

DAY 9:
GOT REFLECTIVE OF DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Today, I took particular interest in the essence of differential privacy.
I tried to explore the implications. To what extent is it going to change anything -
Is it enough to get the trust of data owners because we have a tool that keeps data private?
And to what extent can we assure data owners of privacy?
What is the infrastructure for accountability and validation of claims of privacy?
What should be the tolerance for the failings of differential privacy?
Why is differential privacy a breakthrough?
So, I had to sift through several resources highlighting the issues with DP,
And I am glad to realize that implementing optimum differentially private systems
requires diligence and keen engineering on our part as practitioners, and goes beyond the simple use of the tools.
Of the numerous articles I read, I feel this gives the most simplistic summary:https://www.accessnow.org/differential-privacy-part-2-complicated/
SPAIC is a worthwhile exposure, and gets more interesting!!!!
2. Finally, glad to announce progress from yesterday's image analysis feat. initiated by @shaam.al.shayah.93.
Our approach worked. @shaam.al.shayah.93 nailed it:https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CKRQP9ZLL/p1562443789166200?thread_ts=1562348331.059300&cid=CKRQP9ZLL

In part two of our series on differential privacy, we take a close look at the complexities of implementing the approach.Hey there again, I am very happy to tell you that I figured it out 
There was a column with so many zeros which makes the variance and the standard deviation =0 then somewhere in the math things lead to Nans. So I had to check why this one column had zeros and it was a small mistake I made in my calculations, so fixing that made everything work again!!
But ai look forward to future collaboration again

 *DAY 9 of 60: July 6, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project. I already decided to start working on an easy project, whose dataset is linearly separable. (I could choose a more complex project if I had enough time to do so.) The medical dataset I chose contains features and diagnoses of 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. This medical dataset truly needs privacy! Because we cannot divulge the sexually-transmitted diseases of patients. I started to program the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system. I started to write the documentation of my final project, at least a basic structure of the essay. I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Thank @ikhushpatel for your encouraging words. Moderators selected my answer to the *Question 2: What are the basic building blocks of a deep learning model?* https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562432616409400 I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @christian_tutiven, @gstavocevallos, @ssalvatierra777, and @ruben.romo.gonzalez to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.

Worked on my AI presentation due on friday.
DAY 6: I worked and did research on how to implement ML and DL model deployment using Flask.
DAY 5: I joined my first submission to a Kaggle competition (Recursion Cellular Image Classification) and started my presentation about Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals, more details available in spanish: https://ciespal.org/evento/inteligencia-articial-para-ninos-y-jovenes/
DAY 4: I finished lesson 3, learned about Differential Privacy and how to build a private database in python.
DAY 3: I finished lesson 2, learned about working on a GPU environment while using transfer learning with pre-trained models such as DenseNet and ResNet with Kaggle Datasets.
DAY 2: I learned about Inference, Validation, Precision and Recall. The Validation/Dropout solutions, and lastly about how to save/load the models as checkpoints.
DAY 1: I accepted the challenge and continued learning lesson 2: Deep Learning with PyTorch modeling with the MNIST dataset.#60daysofudacity & #UdacityFacebookScholar #aiuio #aisaturdays #artificialIntelligenceJuly 4, 2019: Paolo Paste posted images on LinkedInCuando: 5 julio, 2019 a las 6:00 pm – 8:30 pm Conferencia dirigida al público en general, en la cuál el objetivo es dar a conocer como los niños desde tempranas edades pueden aprender fundamentos de Inteligencia Artificial de maneras sencillas y prácticas.

D10: I have been having some issues keeping up with the material and have been feeling super self conscious about asking for help. Normally this isn't an issue for me, but because I wanted to learn on my own, I have been working through some introductory classes that are seperate from  Phase 1 on Udacity, including the intro to pytorch. I have also been feeling as if I have very little to contribute as a beginner, but starting today that changes completely. I am going through lesson currently. I am planning on a refresher to github course. I have an external study group that works on Python practice through different applications.

Day 11 - Wow moving right along! Today I've already been working on reading up on Advanced Machine Learning with Python - specifically the k-means clustering. I'm learning using a Packt textbook by John Hearty. It was one of the daily free books I managed to snag. I'm also going to be reading through the_ Introduction to Machine Learning with Python - A Guide for Data Scientists_ book that I purchased through Humble Bundle. I want to use it for when I don't have internet access. I have it downloaded in my Google Drive and saved to my phone, iPad, and laptop so I can make sure I always have it handy. I have a lot more books on Machine Learning and Python, too. In addition to these readings, I am on track to finish up the lesson on Deep Learning with PyTorch and aim to start up Introduction to Differential Privacy tomorrow. I am looking forward to this part since I believe it has a big role in the medical field with HIPAA concerns limiting the available datasets. Anybody have any recommendations for the Differential Privacy readings? I would love to read more about it and would prefer to check out recommendations from other Udacians! @sarahhelena.barmer you're on day 11, too - what are your plans? @vipul.captureart make certain to set aside time today for your #60daysofudacity!

Hi @jaintj95 Thanks and happy it inspires you. I use the asus zenscreen MB16AC, it can be used both horizontally and vertically. Also, I love because it light weight, a 15""6 so portable and connects through one port USB type-C only. https://www.asus.com/Monitors/MB16AC/
However, lately Asus launched a touchscreen version of this with a built-in battery. personally, go for this one it's added features can make coding more enjoyable .. https://edgeup.asus.com/2019/the-zenscreen-touch-mb16amt-is-a-portable-monitor-for-your-laptop-and-phone/
I haven't tried other monitors per say but his screens seem to be the most popular, so I guess definitely reliable. However, they're kinda little bit expensive.
ENJOYWeighing just 800g and only 8mm thin, the 15.6-inch ASUS ZenScreen MB16AC is the world’s lightest, and slimmest, Full HD portable monitor. ZenScreen MB16AC features a hybrid USB Type-C port that supports power and video transmission, and enables compatibility with any laptop with a USB Type Type-C or USB Type-A port. ZenScreen MB16AC has its ownan ultra-thin 1mm foldable smart case, which not only provides protection but also can be turned into a horizontal or vertical stand.The ZenScreen Touch is tailor-made for remote workers and digital nomads who spend most of their time on the road.

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge. 
*Stay Udacious! :audacious_and_humble:*

@sarahhelena.barmer you are welcome!! Hope you can find the books and enjoy them 
 
@mhmohona - I find that using the OneNote program is wonderful. I will take the ‘big idea’ from each video and jot it down in a separate page/document.  Then, at the end of the entire lesson, I will write a 1 page summary of the lesson and the most important parts as well as parts that I need to review. Each day, I will review the lesson’s 1 page summary. If I need more details, I go back into the video’s notes. It works pretty well for me and I can even just make it into a google doc to view anywhere. Reviewing each day for even just 30 minutes helps with the retention of the subject matter.
 
You can also make a recording of yourself saying those notes and save it on your device. I like to use Bluetooth earbuds to listen to my own recordings while I am doing housework and for 10 minutes every night before bed.

Dear diary… and also @drcjudelhi, @pmarcelamq@nesreensada@sfmajors373@pmarcelamq@d.pandey11585@sarahhelena.barmer@evigiannakou I finally had some decent sleep (wow, almost 6 hours) and I’m now in a great mood. Today our little paper club will be holding a virtual meet-up and we will be announcing the winners of our quiz. I had a cup of great coffee and read about the limitations of deep learning. I also spent some time setting up a new website with github pages for the club.

DAY 10:
FIRST BITE OF ENCRYPTED DEEP LEARNING
--------------------------------------------
1. I am early today...I started Encrypted Deep Learning.
*NB: I am using a custom progression.
2. Thanks to @geekykant, I got to share my motivation for this course.https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJCJ5UVH8/p1562493022177000?thread_ts=1562479486.161900&cid=CJCJ5UVH8
3. Still tinkering with pytorch - it's the theme for week 2 for me.
----------------------------
Cheers to @geekykant, @elie.wanko, @shaam.al.shayah.93, @preriec, @anshutrivedik, @george.christ1987, @vivanksharma, @hantwin, @obijoyce, @akadidas1, @vivekspace94, @flonsie17, @learn556, @jluis.samper, , @gfredtech, @erikaleeyoon.I find this principle rewarding. It is helpful for the brain when learning
is not a learn for exam or learn for competition scenario. When the brain is set in that mode, the body sets itself into stress mode and the executive functions that help us to learn become destabilized. Memory, for instance, becomes volatile - you can easily
forget what you have learnt. When we are stressed, the body commits energy to putting us into fight mode and committing things to permanent memory is often not one of the priorities in such a time. Thus:
--> First and foremost, approach this course as an opportunity to learn something useful which you will use to change the world. Approach it like a game or something fun, and
visualize the concepts in real world scenarios that are meaningful to you.
--> Go at your own pace - we have a month and three weeks. Of course, we all want to get selected
to the next phase. But, let the love for the things you are learning push you there.
--> Contribute regularly on the slack community because you genuinely want to help us - your colleagues.
--> Join challenges because you have love for the things you are building.
--> Give thumbs up to people who are doing great things because they are genuinely doing great things.
--> And motivate other people to hang in here, because to be selected among 5000 from 14000, for a technology which is trending is a golden opportunity for us all.
Subsequently, before you realize, this course will become more useful and automatically you will be
doing things that will increase your chances of being selected for the next phase.
Cheers @geekykant!

- Especially working on the simple project, making a linear model, and training it with our worker named ‘bob’, I could not figure out the variables and how to structure them to fit to the requirements of the question.
I should work harder!
I have typed the same code two times more, so that I can remember things such was format, structure, and the process of it more thoroughly.

Day 11/60:
Did not get time to proceed with my revision of the course work. Proceeded with my Human Pose Estimation Project.
Today, I did some data exploration of the COCO dataset and the MPII dataset. The COCO dataset is more easily accessible and hence, I am going to proceed with it. It was a difficult task but what keeps me motivated is the fact that in the future, I am probably going to be working on data in similar formats. I have done my fair share of Kaggle competitions and their datasets are too straightforward. Such types of data and the problems they pose is more challenging but once we get the results, this is way more rewarding too. I will continue my efforts and hope to have something presentable by the end of this challenge.
My work will be updated on this repository: https://github.com/myidispg/StanceNet

- Continued coding in 8 different types of GANs in my Generative Dog Images competition using pytorch. Still resolving the stability on training procedure as it gives
questionable loss values between generator and discriminator. Found also that my TensorFlow implementation is way better than pytorch. Will try to implement spectral
normalization in pytorch if this one will become helpful. Revisited also this paper: Improved Techniques for Training GANs: https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498

Day 10:
Finally, I finished the Data Scientist with Python Track on DataCamp.
I finished the last three courses in a day including:
1. Machine Learning with Tree Based Models - provides a new set of intuition for me of CARTs, Random Forests, AdaBoost and Gradient Boosted trees
2. Deep Learning in Python - gave me the best intuition about linear mappings, activation function, gradient descent, and backpropagation.
3. Network Analysis in Python - the most fun course in the whole track which introduced me to a new kind of data structure - graphs in representing networks.
I had so much fun with the specialization. It helped me a lot since I came from an R background. With this, I will be able to continue my learning schedule in Secure and Private AI by reviewing the course from the start.
You can look my certificate here:https://www.datacamp.com/statement-of-accomplishment/track/e9e4789543d1f100b2714f4fdbcf7eb8d4fa7fa9#60daysofudacityAlexander Villasoto earned a statement of accomplishment on DataCamp for completing Data Scientist !

*#60daysofudacity Day 11*
1. Reviewed crucial CNN concepts to Computer Vision application, most notable of which is image augmentation, a technique that can be used to introduce more translational invariance and some rotational invariance to the model, which will prove to be particularly useful for my Kaggle group projects.
2. Have had my first weekly study buddy group meeting at #sg_datasyfters with @fridarode00... We found some very interesting and promising research papers on diabetic retinopathy detection involving the use of Deep Learning techniques for our Kaggle Blindness Detection competition. Also discussed about how we should best approach the problem, and decided on first processing the data for visualization and investigation of the data provided by the organizers.
3. Learned about some really cool and relatively new CNN architectures such as AlexNet, VGGNet, and ResNet which originated in some image classification competition.
Would encourage @rumanubhardwaj to keep up with her good work in this Challenge!

The overfitting is gone and the model can learn more now. So fingers crossed.

Day 8: Transfer learning - Impact of the number of hidden layers 4
The results show me that additional hidden layer will slow down the accuracy. With only one hidden layer we will reach higher than 90% quicker compare with others while ten hidden layers will be the slower to reach more than 90% accuracy.
I am thinking is that because dog and cat classification is only two outputs? Ia that why additional hidden layer will not be beneficial to out training? What do you think?
I spent long time on this since I want to absorb the concept better. Thank you @mikaelaysanchez for telling me that some have just started the course.

*Day 11*:
1. Submitted programming assignments (week 2) of the Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursera, which I couldn't do before. Had to learn Octave programming language to do so. Will finish and submit lesson 3 assignments within this week.
2. Started Lesson 3 of the SPAIC.
3. Started Lesson /week 3 of Andrew Ng's Machine learning course on Coursera.
( *P.S. 2 small mistakes of mine I made during my day 7, day 9 and day 10 updates.*
1. Day 7: I mentioned I am halfway done with Lesson/week 3 of Andrew Ng's Machine learning course. Whereas it was Week 2.
2. Day 9 and 10 another mistake. I mentioned progressed and completed L1 of SPAIC instead of L2.
Apologies for the mistakes! I did not notice them before.)
Thankyou so much for your encouragement @minassouane , @pratikthakare65 , @munniomer  and @urvi151197 !

Hoping to make my own contribution on Medium soon. I also went and checked on what is happening in each of the 4 study groups that I am part of, took stock of the situation and took part in many polls regarding future meetups.

This measurement process has received intense attention in recent years. We divided this process into the registration of the face, landmarking, morphometric quantification and dimension reduction. Face registration is the process of standardizing pose and landmarking annotates positions in the face with anatomic description or mathematically defined properties (pseudolandmarks). Morphometric quantification computes pre-specified transformations such as distances.LandmarkingWe review face registration methods which are required by some landmarking methods. Although similar, face registration and landmarking are distinct problems. The registration phase can be seen as a pre-processing step and can be combined independently with a landmarking solution. Existing approaches for landmarking differ in their data requirements, modeling approach, and training complexity. In this review, we focus on 3D surface data as captured by commercial surface scanners but also cover methods for 2D facial pictures, when methodology overlaps. We discuss the broad categories of active shape models, template based approaches, recent deep-learning algorithms, and variations thereof such as hybrid algorithms. The type of algorithm chosen depends on the availability of pre-trained models for the data at hand, availability of an appropriate landmark set, accuracy character...

*Day 4:* #60daysofudacity
Ok, I've just had a 3 or 4 days break from the slack, I even don't remember if I was at day 3 or 4 last time 
I begin by the less interesting, which is my coding.
While my LSTM model keeps training, I began to write my capstone report for MLND. I have to finish that so I can move on to new things because I'm always waiting to have better results with my neverending modelization. So I decided to present my not so bad model and explain how I'll improve it later. I'll also do some cleaning in my local repository that I didn't put on github for a while (shame on me). I'll tell you all when my report will be online and I hope you will give me feedback.
Most interesting was our meeting with @mary.romanenko and @tumi_molamu . You were both really inspiring persons! I am really admirative of what you have already achieved professionally in the IT world. I hope I'll be that brilliant too!
After that, I had a quick look on Coursera and for Tensorflow 2.0, it seems to me that there is a brand new course in 4 parts from deeplearning.ai, and even though it is not Andrew NG doing it, it seems that it follows the structure of its introduction to deep learning (without the methodological parts such as hyperparameter optimization). So this looks great, it is in my to-do list, and if you want to do it please let me know!

thanks @vincivenv! Actually got a question already.. from what i saw, Bert itself is a model already right? so we dont need to apply it on top of deep neural network like RNN / LSTM right? But we can use a pre-trained model from HuggingFace and just tune a couple of layers in order to fit our purpose?

*Day 10: Completed!* Organizational and promoting work for my study group #sg-europeers. Reached more than 30 people! Participated in a great and massive slack thread, about our first day in this scholarship channel  I watched the interview of OpenAI, at the end of the *Differential Privacy Lesson*.  Moreover, I started with *Federated learning* (introductory videos).
What about you? @sabrinajodexnis and @ishgagno

Well today I apparently broke all my conda environments trying to install OpenCV. Spent most of my morning reinstalling everything but I finally got it working again.
After making my cnn model yesterday for facial gesture recognition, I got an outstanding 85% accuracy on my own dataset, and most of the wrong predictions were pretty ambiguous or simply wrongly labeled images! :celebrate:
Now I want to capture my camera and start making real time prediction for an old project of mine I’m trying to resurrect!

*DAY 9 [15.0%] | 60* #60daysofudacity
[1] Project: Implement Local Differential Privacy [completed]
[2] Applying variations to the project [1] [adding different values of epsilon, plots, run more tests]
*What I learn:*
Today I learn about how the amount of data can impact the queries over a data base. More precisely, I set up an experiment, where the mean query was executed with different entries in a database. I notice that, each time the entries increase, the approximation for the real value of the mean query was more close. Meaning the differential data come more close to the real result of the query on the real data. When repeating this experiment multiples times I observed the same results. At first, with less entries, the distance in the results where big. However, the more entries, the more close the results were to the real ones. This result reaffirms the discussion on the lectures.

Day 6 of #60daysofudacity: I fit in what I could during our train ride back from our vacation spot. As internet was intermittent as best I focussed on going over the documentation and associated tips in lesson 2 and then in the Udacity pytorch course, to get a more in-depth understanding of the basics. Excited about the study group channels starting to happen! Motivating @sanskriti.bajaj98 and @hillc255
 
Day 7 of #60daysofudacity : Today was my wedding anniversary and our first day back from holidays, so I struggled to find time for my 30 minutes, especially as I also had some trouble signing into Slack from my home based computer. I also had to miss some virtual meet-ups of my awesome women's study groups that I would have loved to attend. That's all sorted now though, thankfully, and I managed to continue going over the Pytorch basics. Hoping to finish the challenge in #sg_novice_ai on time! Motivating @hawk.praxs533 and @kholoud.hemmat.

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge. 
*Stay Udacious! :audacious_and_humble:*

I worked on the deep_learn_Pytorch sections and even though I am substantially behind, I am slowly working my way through the lessons. My goal is to work one a few notebooks a day to catch up.

 *DAY 10 of 60: July 7, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project. I continued programming the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. I continued writing the documentation of my final project, at least a basic structure of the essay. Today, I met David Dávila @daviddavilahp, an Ecuadorian neuroscientist who lives in Quito, the capital of Ecuador. I added him to our Study Group #sg_ecuador. It is refreshing to find people who are passionate about both artificial intelligence and neuroscience. I love neuroscience as well and I would like to study an online masters in neuroscience, if possible. Here is our conversation: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CL5KYB9FX/p1562527182006800 I motivated my classmates from Ecuador @christian_tutiven, @gstavocevallos, @ssalvatierra777, @ruben.romo.gonzalez, and @daviddavilahp to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity. I recently received my 2 AGI t-shirts that I bought in January 26, 2018. My first shipment was lost due to a hurricane in Florida. My second shipment was lost for an unknown reason. And finally my third shipment arrived without problems. Fortunately Teespring paid for the reprints. So, I only paid for 2 t-shirts.
*Nowadays, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a legitimate and very active field of research, as you can see in these links:*https://agi.mit.edu/http://agi-conf.org/
I have so many ideas and papers to publish in the AGI Conferences.

Day 12:  Continue to monitor study group adding information, resources and guides to get community on the same page. #sg_work_using_gcp .   Had a Datasyfters meetup with @krisastern. Went over basic project startup for the kaggle competition. Datasyfters Meeting minutes July 7, 2019    Greetings, then talked about types of  data and how to work with it.  We decided to sample images to check quality.  Then talked how images may need data prep to help classification. Talked about the labels and if all images had labels. Decided to check test batch.  Using this code to start https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/aptos-2019-densenet-keras-starter  We will keep in touch until next meetup. (45 minute meeting).

@paul.stancliffe I like it too  Berg means mountain. So it means you got on the top of the mountain by having the half of the work done. The second half is easier, because you’re not climbing anymore, but going down.

Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge.

Day 11: (this is going to be a ""story"" of 4 days  , bit cheesy too maybe.. )
It all began with just randomly looking,  over https://www.kaggle.com/ again on July of 4th (to be honest, which I have been doing for a while now in thee hindsight) , after such major interest in the group and people posting stuff on papers, competitions and their submissions... I have known kaggle for over a year now but never really got dedicated enough for getting involved...
But randomly out of blue I had a moment, it happened when I somehow reached this -> https://www.kaggle.com/anokas ... This really inspired me and I had a resolution with a mate @bow1226, to be ""a grandmaster by the end of two years from July of 6th, 2019"". As far as taking resolutions go generally, they are just the things that we say with implementations being in dreams only, but fortunately till now for me it's been very real. I got my first submission made with a score of ""0.9999"".. 
But to be brutally honest, it is much more satisfying from inside than looking and wondering from outside, taking the step does need effort but the sanctification is incomparable.
The point of sharing a comparably personal and boring message, is to hopefully inspire some people, that have been thinking only like me, to get motivated by whatever they find motivating, and that's totally a ""DIY-Do It Yourself"" task because people can only tell you, try to motivate by their initiatives but those are all exhaustive element, until you yourself give fuel to the spark. .
Kaggle is really some supportive platform, you will find great help, at discussions and be in company of similar amazing people that you find here.(So, advertising has begun.. )
On final note, I would really be happy if more of you guys come and join me, and make this journey a one to remember for life, believe me I am also just beginning with it, so it's really universal set...

3. Reviewed some more on CNN, but am gauging that I will need to study a bit more to be proficient in it. Some concepts of note for me are the use of capsule networks versus pooling.
4. Learning about style transfer. Am particularly fascinated by this creative use of a trained CNN given only the content and style images as input.

This model has more to learn. But we are getting the limit with the light weight model. So planning to deploy this light weight model by weekend and continue our journey with deeper model.
Creating a sequence model of lstm and gru which will classify the words by languages.
This week I am planning to start to work on a denoising autoencoder.

*Day 12: #60daysofudacity*
• Almost completed RNN section of the introductory course to pytorch.
• Summarised everything i've learned from Alexnet architecture and moved to the inception series and found inceptionv4.
• Going through the generalizations in differential privacy and i think i'm now much clarified in terms of bounds across the sensitivity across a query. Check out Alpha-net mechanism. 
• Implemented my very first RNN and successfully classified the names.
• Initiated Week-1/ Pytorch Beast Program in #sg_novice-ai would like to thank @labknr98@goodfriend2899@kumarprabhu244 for their tremendous support ^-^

# Musical Genre Classification of Song Lyrics
## Authors

Department of Computer Science, Stanford Universitycaryl@stanford.edu
## Abstract
What is it in a song that allows us to immediately determine: “that’s rap”, or: “that’s country”? For the learned ear, music genre classification comes naturally. In this paper we attempt to teach an untrained computer to predict the genre of a song purely from an examination of the song’s lyrical content, using various machine learning techniques. Can we give good quality recommendations as to what a user should listen to next based purely off the lyrics of a song and nothing else? This paper looks deeply at thousands of songs to determine if there are patterns in the lyrics between genres.
## 1. Introduction
Music recommendation and recommendation systems in general play a huge role in the way we currently consume media. The experiences given by different applications such as Youtube, Netflix and Spotify rely vastly on consistently bringing high quality content that the user will enjoy to the user. As a result of the scale of these companies, most current industry practices revolve around collaborative filtering approaches. These types of techniques rely on having large amounts of user behavior data and content metadata (i.e. if person A and B like song C, and person B likes song D, then person A will like song D). These techniques work very well, but are limited in that they can only be effective if there are large amounts of user data available, the likes of which only a few companies have access to.
At a high level this paper attempts to examine and extract the latent semantic meaning present within the lyrical content of songs in the context of their genres. This is explored with two interrelated goals. Firstly, we aim to understand the relationship between the lyrics of a song and its genre and will test this by attempting to predict the genres of songs based on their lyrics. Secondly, we will attempt to make relevant and similar music recommendations to users once again purely based on the lyrics of songs.
## 2. Related Work
There have been several attempts in recent years to use machine learning techniques to classify songs into their respective genres. As mentioned earlier, industry relies mostly on collaborative filtering approaches on user behavior data. However there has been some work done on classifications and recommendations based on the actual content of the media.
These attempts have relied mostly on sonic analysis approaches, and have had limited success. A classifier is built to predict upon the actual audio of the song, using fourier transforms. Previous papers such as Fell and Gossi have used linear classification models trained on music lyrics in a similar fashion to this paper.
## 3. Gathering Data/Feature Selection
### Dataset
Our dataset is derived from the musiXmatch dataset, a subset of the famous Million Song Dataset (MSD) that includes the lyrics of 237,701 songs in addition to their other data as taken from the original MSD. Both datasets are curated by LabROSA, a musicological institution at Columbia University.
The lyrics are stored in a bag-of-words format, where words are represented as positive integers. For efficiency, only the top 5000 most frequently uttered words in the total song vocabulary were included. Therefore, each song’s lyrics are delineated by the a list of (token, n) tuples, where n is the number of instances of that token (i.e. word) in the song. We are also given a mapping of integer tokens to their corresponding word, which comes in lemmatized form.
At this point, we vectorized the lyrical data into 5000-dimensional vector representations (one for each token/word), where the value for every dimension is equal to the number of instances of the corresponding token/word in a given song. Therefore, most values are zero.
### Preprocessing: Matching musiXmatch Song ID to MSD Song ID
As it exists, the musiXmatch dataset keeps track of songs by a different ID system than that of the original Million Songs Dataset. Since LabROSA does not provide a mapping of musiXmatch song ID to song name/album/artist, it was necessary to do so ourselves by means of the following process:
* Match musiXmatch song ID to MSD song ID using the mapping provided by LabROSA: http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/mxm_779k_matches.txt.zip
* Match the corresponding MSD song ID to the song name/album/artist using the same mapping
After completing this, we knew which songs were which in our musiXmatch dataset. By using the data categories included in the MSD dataset, we could now work on collecting genre information and mapping it to musiXmatch song ID.
### Preprocessing: Genre Class Creation
We were unable to extract genre information from the MSD without some form of preprocessing, because it does not include “genre” proper as a data category. Instead, it assigns a set of labels called “tags”, which could be anything from broad genre (e.g. “rock”) to ultra-specific genre (e.g. “Australian didgeri-bluegrass”) to something else entirely (e.g. “this goes hard in the paint bro”). These tags are scraped from tags provided real-world listeners on Last.fm.
Due to the large variety of tags, we needed to devise a method for isolating the broad genre tags and assigning them to each song ID as a new data category. The process we implemented is as follows:
* Download the Last.fm tags sqlite database provided by LabROSA: http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/lastfm/lastfm_tags.db
* Derive the tid.csv and tags.csv files from the sqlite database by saving all the unique values of each respective field to a one-column csv file.
* Derive the tid_tag.csv file from the sqlite database to a csv of the following format: The tid_tag.csv file consists of three columns, being ""track_id"", ""tag_id"", and ""score"" (which is the number of times that tag was used for that track). Each row is a unique track-and-tag pair. This means that many rows will have the same track id but different tag ids, and likewise many rows will have the same tag id but different track ids. This should be relatively simple to implement using a sqlite script.
* Remove all tags not included in the pre-selected genres we decided to use for this project: pop, rock, hip-hop, country, metal, electronic, alternative, r&b
* Count the number of instances of genre tags for each genre for each song
* Assign the genre with the most instances to the given song as the song’s genre
### Preprocessing: Distribution Correction
At this point, we successfully created a dataset of song IDs to their de facto genre as voted by real-world listeners. However, analysis of the distribution of representation across our 8 genre classes indicated a highly uneven dataset:
<img width=""707"" alt=""screen shot 2018-06-23 at 4 04 14 am"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25094252/41807857-b82ff040-769a-11e8-9acb-12bb91844c66.png"">
Given that “r&b” was extremely underrepresented even compared to the second least common genre (“alternative”), we decided to simply remove it as a genre, leaving 7 genres total.
We then sampled every genre the same number of times as the number of songs in the “alternative” genre, producing a smaller but evenly distributed dataset of 62,706 songs.
## Feature Selection
For feature selection, we opted for (1) term frequency – inverse document frequency reweightings (TF-IDF) of the lyrics vectors, as well as (2) the 7 cosine distances of the lyrics vector of a given song from the average vector of each genre. TF-IDF is a well-established reweighting method that has been shown to provide more informatio…

Also, for the kaggle competition have already gained some hands on experience with gcp, learned to train and deploy a TensorFlow model to Cloud ML Engine for serving (prediction) and data prep.Responses are not so huge will try to make some improvements and introduce a webinar this weekend to get to know peers and create some energy in group.Differential privacy is used in two very distinct contexts. Come learn about the distinction between the two, and interesting new directions that combine them!

Day 8 of #60daysofudacity: I continued to go back over the mathematical basics of neural network by reviewing lesson 2 of the ""Intro to Pytorch"" Udacity course - which is part of the challenge in the #sg_novice-ai channel. I feel pretty comfortable with the concepts of deep learning, but translating the details into code is a bit of a sticking point for me, so I am going slow. I am keeping looking back at the steps I have already completed in the pytorch intro (#l1_deep_learn_pytorch ) to put everything together.
I would like to motivate @hillc255 to carry on with the challenge and invite @fpaulin to join it if she hasn't or else send her some strength to find some time to continue amidst looking after her daughter's broken foot - wishing a speedy recovery!

*DAY 10 [16.7%] | 60* #60daysofudacity
[1] Adding final variations to the Project from Lesson 5 [plot more functions]
[2] Beginning to work on the final project for Lesson 5.
*What I learn:*
Today I decided to continue with the experiments from the last project. This time, I added four extra queries: cumulative sum, random sum, logarithm sum and standard deviation. After running the experiments, I noticed that using the cumulative query, one can approximate the real query on the data base with little entries. However, increasing the entries, will also increase the gap between the queries. This is also true for the random sum and logarithm sum queries. On the contrary, the standard deviation query, acts in the same fashion as the mean query. Where with more data, the results will better approximate. This help me to understand that, not all queries behave in the same ways. Therefore, when applying global privacy, one must careful consider the used mechanisms.

*TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION*:
Carrot - technical specification
Created by Andrei Li
Last updated less than a minute ago
Description
Carrot is a tensorboard for PyTorch with extended functionality. You can not only see a graph of the model but can visually see gradients and look at how they behave. Moreover, Carrot allows visualizing optimized parameters of the neural network.
Workflow
A user defines dataloader and creates a model.
For training, user pass: model, dataloader, number of epochs, use_cuda parameter to a function provided.
This function saves: epoch number, training loss, validation loss, training accuracy. validation accuracy, optimized parameters, and gradients into MongoDB database.
Then the user starts Carrot which is a web application and can do an analysis of a neural network.
Functionality
There are four tabs available for the user:
Loss - loss and accuracy metrics.
Model - graph of the model.
Parameters - visualized parameters of the neural network.
Gradients - visualized gradients of the neural network.
Implementation
STACK:
Dash
MongoDB
COMPONENTS:
Jupyter Notebook(JN) side - responsible for collecting and uploading data in MongoDB database.
Dash side - responsive for visualization and interaction with the user.
JN
Python script responsible for training.
Collecting information about your model and training data of your model.
MongoDB schema:
Epoch
Training loss
Validation loss
Training accuracy
Validation accuracy
Dictionary of numpy arrays with parameters.
Dictionary of numpy arrays with gradients.
Dash side
Class for querying data from database with the following methods:
def _init_()
self.epoch - list.
self.training_loss - list.
self.testing_loss - list.
self.training_acc - list.
self.testing_acc - list.
self.parameters - dict.
self.gradients - dict.
def queryLayer(layer, grad=False) - responsible for querying data for a particular layer for gradients and parameters.
2. Class for Mongo DB.
Conclusion
Development of analytics software is a very hard task. The end date of my project is the end of August. The final date of SPAIC. I hope to catch on with that date.

Day 7 of #60daysofudacity: Did a quick revision of all the topics covered so far. Thought this would be useful at this halfway mark. Also read the inspiring story of a Secure and Private AI scholar, Mateusz Zatylny on the Udacity blog. Truly reinforces the idea that any magnitude of positive change can start with one person's gaining of a skill or passion for learning. Also read up a few other articles related to habits that help increase work productivity on Medium and also some articles related to Privacy. Hoping to make progress on brand new lessons tomorrow.  I want to encourage @ltruncel and @manishajhunjhunwala7 for all their awesome progress on #60daysofudacity ! Keep it up guys!

Yeaaay only the last lesson to go... I am sure this is now going to give me that last exam syndrome kinda feeling   Working on the FATQS website and collecting the newly posted questions and their informative responses  In our #sg_clan group, we have 33 members now and we all are deciding on what projects we can do together or in small groups to progress together! Lastly, the kind of bullets that I am using reflects the melodious tunes that I have been listening throughout the evening and from the day I have known about this app, I was always in awe!
Check out this app guys:https://mubert.com/
It's an AI generated music app apt for all kind of moods
What's better than an app which will you keep you motivated throughout to excel in AI !!!
I am so in love with this that now I want to learn how does music gets generated by AI...
I wonder if anyone of you have worked on music generation in AI, please DM me, I so want to know how to do this and learn

2. I'm REALLY exhausted in my trials to implement model.share() on custom datasets but yes I'm still doing it and will see it to the end No matter what 
3. Have been busy with my appdev internship, so kinda lying dormant. Discussed and prepared the architecture of my deep learning based parking management system project (wish me luck)
4. Also one of my projects (advanced multipurpose robot and development) got selected for regional rounds of a national level competition! :)
I would further like to encourage fellow scholars  @bhadreshpsavani@ikhushpatel@oss71995@aysha.kamal7@nasipurisoumya@adventuroussrv@sfmajors373@yemissi.kifouly@aakashsingh9901@amirsayani726 To continue being marvellous at the #60daysofudacity Challenge!!!

Day 12
1. I am still working on the group project (food-101). with @arkachkrbrty@ash3ax@prakhar.tripathi2205@mudeledimeji@manishajhunjhunwala7
I broke my previous high accuracy 2 times for today.... Still running the second 30epoch... ( almost 60 epochs from 12AM ). For a model  <=100MB I think we have a breakthrough... I am super happy about this.. I will not give up on this challenge!
We will push our light models to their limits and after this we will start again this journey with the heavy-champion models..
We are planning to deploy the highest accuracy (light) model on heroku
2. Studied and applied the multi crop augmentation on several datasets just to master this concept...
I did a quick test on the funny dataset with simpsons, I have about 80% accuracy only with this transformation... so the concept of multi crop works well 
3. Improved the already improved fruit classification model...
For some reason every day I have different number of classes of fruits...  the kernel isnt stable dont know why...
4. Studied and created an auto encoder (first time for me.. ) with the german traffic signs dataset. I still have a lot to learn on this concept.
5. I searched 6 side projects for our group members and created a poll...
6. @arkachkrbrty@ash3ax@mudeledimeji@prakhar.tripathi2205@manishajhunjhunwala7

Day 12: #60daysofudacity
Today I did some transfer learning of my own., I started to explore the tensor-flow course on Udacity to see how applicable the learnings from Pytorch are in tensor-flow. Surprisingly, they are not so different at all, the general concept and approach to building deep learning models are almost the same and it is refreshing to know how much knowledge can be transferred from this course to other courses.
I'd like to thank @workwithpurpose and @arkachkrbrty for the constant motivation and I'd like to motivate @sumanyurosha, @gogulaanand02, @ash3ax to keep sharing their updates.

Dear Diary and also @drcjudelhi@pmarcelamq@sfmajors373@nesreensada@sarahhelena.barmer@evigiannakou Today I failed driving theory exam, because yesterday I decided that actiiiivities were more important (wrong). Never do that - even though the activities stuff is so aggressive with all these endless tags and announcements and comittements to participate in 100500 conversations… *don’t fail your life like I do.*
That being said. Covered 800 questions of theory two times and then spent the remainder of my energy on the notebook on differential privacy. I still don’t enjoy the idea of obligatory daily posting.

Day 12
New rules regarding storing progress in an external resource are very disappointing but we have to follow it. Please see the latest message in #announcements. It's very motivating to receive feedback that moves you forward.
RESULTS:
- I wrote a function that automizes storing neural network training data in MongoDB.
- The only thing is to train a model and populate MongoDB with data.
- Nice think of the day http://mongodb.org offers a free shared machine on Azure, AWS to work remotely with zero cost.
- I will post credentials to my MongoDB database with reading access if somebody wants or need gradients or parameters for some purpose. For example, writing an analytical application like me.
- So my journey continues. After programming backend for Carrot and finishing with visualization, I will go and try Amazon AWS CLI. I am still a beginner user of CLI.We're the creators of MongoDB, the most popular database for modern apps, and MongoDB Atlas, the global cloud database on AWS, Azure, and GCP. Easily organize, use, and enrich data — in real time, anywhere.

@electric.blake I am sorry to hear that, I have never tried this test so far. But I know from other people that it is not easy to pass it from the first time, at least in our country. I have seen that you are doing a great job for the community with the study club, and this is an activity that should be recorded since it is related with the concepts of this course. I think that it is not necessary to press yourself for more, especially when you have other priorities. I agree with @sarahhelena.barmer, it's nice when other people are thinking of us but it isn't possible to reply back each time. At least this is something that we can do at our own pace, without a time limit! Anyway, I wish you all the best! Btw, I don't like the idea of the repo to follow our whole activity, it's crazy to feel that we have to add this in our huge todo list, so if this is obligatory I will stop as well because I already have many other commitments!

Interesting that he speaks about compressing the networks. Combining it with federated learning get a lot of new perspectives. If we are able to calculate more complex networks on mobile devices, we could create better models using less resources. If you have an idea about new ways of utilization, share in a comment.  Mobile devices could be calculate more useful tasks than predict emojis or words during typing.

Therefore, I was reading a little bit about the Unix commands to handle github repositories. Here is the announcement: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJQ1C1X08/p1562610830350200 I have read another message in #announcements about the #sg_project-t-shirt competition.

Here is the link of the #sg_project-t-shirt competition: http://bit.ly/tshirt-project_spaic Today, I participated again in the competition *Boom with the Basics* in the channel #beginners. I answered 4 questions about artificial intelligence, 15 minutes per question. This contest was *1 intense hour* of writing answers.

Sure @susyjame. Our group, sg_scorchers has determined we want to focus on a group project for the Keystone Project in Lesson 9 which requires us to pick a project to demonstrate two of the concepts we learn in this Course. Many of us, including me are still not on lesson 9 but we think it is possible to catch up. Our idea is around using patient data set to demonstrate the key aspects of two of the concepts we learn in this course, such as Federation, Encryption, Differential Privacy, Anonymization etc. We have a large vision around using NLP for classifying Doctor notes, and demo using web app etc., but moving other parts to later phases so we can get the first phase in time for Keystone.

*Day 12*
*Completed:* Started planning out my keystone project for this course.  I would like to start with the tutorial on OpenMined for federated learning on Raspberry Pis and do something cool with that. (https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/) I was taking inventory of what was needed and I should have everything to start that, except time.  I have a college course that started this morning and I need to write a discussion post on 7 chapters of reading on Wednesday.  So, I need to take it easier until I settle in and can do the majority of my reading on the weekend prior to the course.  Oh well.  I got in a half hour today and I'll just do my best the rest of the week.
*Encouraging:* @ragnagus *Stay Udacious!* and conquer the day!  @sarahhelena.barmer for being awesome and @bow1226 for being super smart.  Oh and all of the t-shirt team because we are doing awesome things over there: @ewotawa@krts18199@ltruncel@tsmedia.rj and everyone else!In this article, you are going to learn how to setup PySyft on a Raspberry PI and how to train a Recurrent Neural Network in a federated way.Written byDaniele GadlerFiled underFederated Learning, Deep Learning, PySyft, PyTorch, Tutorials, Machine Learning, Raspberry PI, Private ML, Neural networks

Day 12:
Well, today I spent most of the time making the script that captures my camera and predicts my facial gesture from it. I got it working, but apparently my dataset is not large enough to generate good predictions on unseen data! Either that or I always look sad 
To generate better results, I looked up for datasets with facial gestures and found this one:https://ai.google/tools/datasets/google-facial-expression/
I’m gonna start working on this dataset and see if I can generate better results.
I’ve also established what my final project will be about :skin-tone-2: I’ll start working on it sooner than later.
Lastly, I’ve been working on my CV, as I’m about to graduate form college. I’ll see if I can get it done for the Openmined RAAIS… who knows, I may be eligible :thinking_face:
This will be my last update without documenting it on a repo! After documenting, should we still post updates here?

• Completed project 'Perform a differencing attack' and updated github repository https://github.com/dumeer00/SecureAndPrivateAIChallenge/blob/master/Lesson%204%20Evaluating%20The%20Privacy%20Of%20a%20Function.ipynb. (All the code developed is original and works in different ways than shown in project demo).
• Completed Lesson 4.
• Watched first 3 videos of Lesson 5. The example of local differencial privacy with social studies (jaywalking) was truly interesting, one of the coolest ideas i've read today. Will begin to implement Lesson 5 projects tomorrow.
• Trying to coordinate the study group #sg_latecomers-united for making a virtual meetup. Come on guys! @souvikb1812@sukhwal.niki@vananrajaindern@souvikb1812@debopriyo2007@rohankhollamkar@pranita.shrestha@bobokal

- I downloaded the book ""Algorithm Foundations of Differential Privacy"" and the paper ""Deep Learning with Differential Privacy"".
- I had problems with the installation of pysyft library, so now still solving this problem.
- Finished watch lesson 6 videos, but because pysyft problem I couldn´t do the noteboks. I dont want to loose more time so I decided watch videos and when the problem be solved repeat all.
- I read the book ""Machines of loving Grace"" (page 45).
- I studied the math of planning trajectories for quadcopters.

Day 11:
1. Completed Lesson 9: Encrypted Deep Learning and therefore completed the course.
“ I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors and I applaud you for taking privacy so seriously. It’s the early days for this technology and by taking this course, you are set apart in the field of AI for both for your expertise in this field as well as for your morally admirable passion for privacy ”.
2. Requested @akshit to add a channel for *keystone project*. In the last Lesson 9 we are asked to create a capstone project. It will be useful to share ideas, help one another and work together. Alternatively, we should have something like  *#l9_encrypt_deep_learn* channel as it looks like there is a lack of channel for the last lesson.
3. Took part in Boom with the Basics weekly quiz. I am very proud of myself as I have answered all the questions

:alertt: *Make way for two Important Updates!!!* :alertt:First One*Create Personal Repository for Daily Updates of #60daysofudacity Challenge*
We are glad to see the spirited involvement :sonic-running: from all of you in the #60daysofudacity Challenge! :clapping-animated-inclusive: To help us track and verify your progress and engagement in the challenge, we request you to document your daily updates in a single repository.*How should I create this repository?* :thinking_face:
It can be anything from Google Sheets to Google Docs, from Trello boards to Github Repositories. Just that when you complete the challenge, you should be able to share it with us so that we can have a look at it!:arya::+1::skin-tone-2:*What exactly is to be recorded in this repository?*:thinking_face:
4 major things that you need to record in this repository are: Date, Corresponding Day of your challenge (eg. Day 5), Activities that you did on that day & Links associated to the work/activities (if any!) :penguin_dance::penguin_dance:
A sample (*read ‘SAMPLE’*) repository can be something like this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYYnSjVKefmtUtLgUn8VDi2IToEhXW0eAGeuaShErp8/edit?usp=sharing
:alert:*[It is not mandatory to make yours in google sheets only, the choice is yours, this one is just to give you an idea of how you can record the updates]*:alert:*What about updates of days that I have already completed?*:thinking_face:
For days that you have already completed, if you can find your corresponding slack posts for them,  just copy paste those in the repository. If you are unable to find your previous posts in slack, then you can start posting updates in the repository from your current day (in that case your repository will not start from Day 1, don’t worry, it is acceptable.)  :bananadance::bananadance:*I am already maintaining such a record, do I need to create another?* :thinking_face:
No! If you have already been maintaining such a record, you need not make another. But make sure that it is shareable with us and keep posting updates in it for your remaining days of the challenge. :yay: :yay:Second One*Creation of New Channels - #channel_request* 
Just wanted to get your attention towards the recent changes on our workspace and the progress towards your channel requests.  *(A HUGE thanks to our rockstar #channel_request moderators for coming up with requests.)*
*Here are the new channels that we have created in the workspace:*#feedback - to report any bugs in the content, to pass out any feedback or any good remarks about any of your peers.#open_src_and_github - Discuss about all things open source directly in this channel including git and github.#seek_advice - Looking for any sort of advice - how to participate in the community, what to do after the challenge, how to score a job etc., just head to this channel.#news - Post and share any news articles and blogs that you think might be useful for the community and directly coincides with the purview of the scholarship.

:alert:*Clarification Regarding Repository Related Update*:alert:
:hi: Hello People! So there was an update shared regarding the #60daysofudacity challenge recently. (You can check details in the #announcements channel!)
After the announcement, many of you had concerns whether you need to post your daily updates in this channel or not since you will be maintaining a repository. Clarifying on that:*It is mandatory to post your regular updates in this (#60daysofudacity) channel. Along with this you need to maintain a repository of your daily updates,  it can even be a simple doc where you copy paste your slack post for the day!*
Just for your reference, a *Sample* repository is added here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YYYnSjVKefmtUtLgUn8VDi2IToEhXW0eAGeuaShErp8/edit?usp=sharing

Day 12: I was about to start activity 7.7. I wanted to experiment with gpu for this, so I decided to adapt Chapter 6's project to use CUDA
Surprisingly, despite cuda, the total time was almost the same. So I decided to profile the code to find out what's happening. And it was surpsing: 90% or more of the total time is spent in getting data from the DataLoaders, the actual training is negligible (because it's a simple model). So, in cases like this, it's not worth to use cuda (unless it's free).
Very valuable lesson today! Tomorrow I'll start the actual 7.7 activity, after that I'll research about improving dataloaders performance (maybe they can be sent to cuda initially)
 
Hi Heather, I want to detect some types of arrythmia, however haven't thought about the algorithm yet (I think I'll have to try different network architectures and see which one fits best). Is your project similar?

One can find their old messages/post from slarck by these methods!
1. CTRL + F and type the username

Day 13
I have just realized after re-reading #announcements that we are not prohibited from posting to #60daysofudacity and keep everything in repo. Repo is just an additional check.
RESULTS:
- Well, MongoDB is populated with training data from a neural network.
- It was a dumb idea to make schema in MongoDB as I made it. Reading through records to find gradients and parameters takes an infinity.
- I need a preprocessing step to increase the speed of operations.
- While my program is executing I am writing this post.
REMINDER:
I am writing pytorchboard in Dash.

Day 11: Tue 9 Jul 2019
1. Federated Learning Cartoon from Google (https://federated.withgoogle.com/)
- This content was really helpful to understand what is the federated learning and how it works. With cartoons, and easy explanation, I feel like I got far closer to deeper understanding of Secure and Private AI. Furthermore, the wide applicable industry areas especially self-driving car, made me feel thrilled and excited by just reading the part! It was already widely known that this technology could be used in health data, but in terms of self-driving car part, I had no idea before.
2. Udacity Secure and Private AI Facebook Challenge: Lecture 7 Federated Learning
- Lecture 8: Garbage collection review
- Lecture 9: Toy Federated Learning, simple exercise codes to deploy the federated learning concept on simple linear model. Sending it, training, and getting the trained, better model back!https://github.com/marofmar/60daysofudacity/blob/master/L7_9_ToyFederatedLearning(Day11).ipynbBuilding better products with on-device data and privacy by default.

Day 13/60:
1. Watched the first 3 videos of Encrypted Deep Learning section in the course.
2. For images with multiple people, there were separate annotations for each person. Now, combined them into a single entry.
3. Worked on showing skeletons for multiple people in an image.
4. Wrote a script to remove useless images from the train and validation set. The useless images are those that do not have a person in them or are not labelled.
I am tracking my progress in a Google Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EGQaIWvp_rdgPaKlRDsUKvgU1GsI4wMO33B8maKWa60/edit?usp=sharing
I encourage @sdeepak852 and @kennedykwangari to start this challenge. You might not have 60 days but this is very good to keep yourself focused.
Though most of my work today was kind of under the hood, here are some images about the improvements I made to skeleton drawing.

Day 9 of #60daysofudacity: Still worming my way through lesson 2 of the “Intro to Pytorch” course. Today was a slow day due to family commitments and I only managed to work through concepts 13-15 and watch a video from lesson 2, but from tomorrow I am kid free for at least two days so hope to catch up and finish most of current challenge in #sg_novice-ai and thereby also lesson 2 of our challenge course. I am definitely starting to feel much more comfortable with the maths now!

Day 10: Differential privacy - Evaluating the differential privacy
- Today I revisited lesson 3 especially about anonimousity. To protect the privacy of dataset, why anonimousity is not enough. I just found out that the lesson video shows some example of de-anonimousity because of leaking of the dataset by others. The definition clearly stated about ""no matter what"". It means if other released dataset leaking the sensitive information, it will not affecting our dataset.
- I continue to lesson 4. However, I stucked on what is the sensitivity value and why we use sensitivity with threshold.https://60daysofudacity.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-10-differential-privacy-evaluating.html@mikaelaysanchez congratz for the exam result.

Day 12:
Milestones:
1. Finish concepts 21 to 35 of Lesson 2 Introduction to Neural Networks.
2. Create my own implementation of gradient descent by implementing activation function, prediction and function that facilitates the update of weights, defined by the learning rate.
3. Delve into the intuitive understanding of backpropagation using sigmoid function.
Learnings:
Backpropagation, to put it simply, calculates the derivative of an error function with respect to each of the weights in the labels by using the chain rule.
As an example, say we have a sigmoid activation function for inputs with one layer before the output.
If we want to get the derivative of an output of a sigmoid function with respect to 1 input (backpropagating), then we disregard other inputs giving them derivative of zero.
With that, we can just multiply the weight of that input (which is constant) by the derivative of the sigmoid function with respect to the input itself. Mathematically, we can express this as:
W_input * d_sigmoid / input
where d_sigmoid / input = sigmoid(input) * (1 - sigmoid(input))
PS. I hope that I put that explanation simply and a big shoutout to @erjcan for appreciating my answer to his question about PCA.#60daysofudacity

1. Today i had worked on some concepts of GAN and style transfer Neural networks and looking for some projects along with @aisha.jv70  and #sg_real_world_ai_proj study group..
2. Huge shout out to @aisha.jv70  for taking a really great initiative for the community in order to work with everyone so as to improve the concepts with the help of her i had created a repository named Udaquest for daily posting of questions by her on the slack and i will be pushing the questions along with the relevant answers to the github repo.. https://github.com/Shashankjain12/Udaquest
3. Revised some previous concepts and will now be heading to 6th lesson .
4. Thanks for encouraging me @susyjame@aisha.jv70@ash15.sulaiman@mariia.denysenko93@urvi151197@anshutrivedik  and looking to work ahead with the community all together in order to grow and learn some new things together..This group is an active initiative for #60daysofudacity for placing the questions and answers related to machine learning for active learning by everyoneLanguageJupyter NotebookLast updated20 hours ago

It was hard to keep up today cuz of current Internship work. Still I managed to find out time for DL.
Task done ::
Studied pytorch as language and was amazed to find out how it is so powerful and and How NN module encapsulate the sequential model unlike keras .https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZbbT5o_s2xrfNyHZsM6ufI0iZENK9xgG
It's a very good resource that I found out. It have clippings from fastai course and blogs .
2. Learnt about effective utilisation of memory during deep learning training by detaching and deleteing the models after use. And using gc library of python. all thanks to @susanwangdshttps://docs.fast.ai/tutorial.resources.html
Special thanks to @amitrajitbose9 for a podcast on Spotify.

Day 13
Look at the pictures two tabs are working in my Carrot web application!
Carrot is a deep learning analysis tool like TensorBoard.
The main feature that it allows to visualize optimization parameters and gradients. The feature that I am working on at the moment.
I have to admit that it is a very hard task. I didn't know Dash but the task is intriguing.
I learnt a lot but I am not stopping.
Application is complex.
My mistakes:
1. Absolutely dumb idea to use MongoDB database it should have been MySQL is just pickle.
2. Performance is a problem. Multidimensional data requires a lot of memory and it will be hard to get started on a mini instance such an application.
3. I solved a performance problem a little. But I will tell you how it is performing after my optimizations.

Day 13:: Learning lesson#5, Differential Privacy Budget::How much epsilon or delta leakage we allow for our analysis.
How much noise should we add?
The amount of noise that we should add to the output of query if function of four things.
1)Type of noise(Gaussian/Laplacian) :: Amount of noise that we are adding depends on the type of noise that we are adding.
2)Sensitivity of query that we are using to query the db.
3)Desired epsilon
4)Desired delta
Laplacian noise takes input parameter beta ,which determines how significant the noise is.
b=sensitivity of the query/epsilon that we want to achieve
Delta is always zero for laplacian noise.
If we set beta to be this value when creating our Laplacian noise, then we know we will have privacy leakage which
is less than or equal to certain amount of epsilon.We dont have to worry about delta because it is always set to zero.
Gaussian noise has non-zero delta, which is why its somewhat less desirable.

*DAY 11 [18.3%] | 60* #60daysofudacity
[1] Finished final project for Lesson 5: Create a Differentially Private Query.
[2] Recap from Lesson 5.
* What I learn:*
Global and local privacy are two types of privacy mechanism which can be implemented. I think that, in the case of deep learning, one could be more inclined to use global privacy, since it only affects the outputs of the model. In contrast, with local privacy, one must change the data. This process could be expensive in some settings. For example, with many images. However I think that local privacy can be applied in the context of machine learning, when cost of transforming the data is low.

DAY 12:
BUILT A SINGLE-LAYER NEURAL NETWORK
WHICH CLASSIFIES SHADES OF GREEN FROM
NON-SHADES OF GREEN, WITH CORE PYTHON
--------------------------------------
1. As almost always, I leveraged only python to build
a simple shades of green classifier. It worked well, but for
it's confusion with yellow. It was an amazing experience to
implement the workings of NN from scratch. Snapshots below.
Link to demo here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/edit/master/Green_shade_classifier/README.rst
2. Reverted to beginning of course and released a completed
notebook to github. https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Udacity_DL_With_Pytorch_Exercises/Part%201%20-%20Tensors%20in%20PyTorch%20(Exercises).ipynb

Today was a very busy day so i couldn't do much 
• Completed project 'Implementing Local Differential Privacy' (and updated corresponding github repository)
• Scheduled mock interview  with @ingusterbets
• Talked with my friend @sumonbanner for making a team to participate in a kaggle competition.
• Read a paper on 'fuzzy k means' algorithm. I find fuzzy logic/algorithms very interesting.
• I was offered a nice data scientist job today. Maybe i will take a short break from my Masters to get additional experience 
• What about you my friends? How was your day? @aniketmitra1997@souvikb1812@pranita.shrestha@preriec

 *DAY 12 of 60: July 9, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar Today I went to the Mechatronics Lab at ESPOL <http://www.espol.edu.ec/> in order to have a long meeting (3 hours) with @christian_tutiven (our classmate of #UdacityFacebookScholar, professor of Mechatronics, and ambassador of STEAM Center and Saturdays.AI), Jaime Palomeque (ambassador of STEAM Center and Saturdays.AI), and some professors of Mechatronics. And we talked about many things:
- the contents of this nanodegree and why it is important;
- the final project of this nanodegree;
- PySyft and PyTorch;
- my involvement in a Deep Learning startup to analyze facial emotions, verbal emotions, and body language;
- some ideas to analyze facial emotions by using convnets, facial landmarks, RNNs, and GANs. I watched again all the video lectures of *Lesson 8 - Securing Federated Learning*. I watched again all the video lectures of *Lesson 9 - Encrypted Deep Learning*. I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @christian_tutiven, @gstavocevallos, @ssalvatierra777, @ruben.romo.gonzalez, @daviddavilahp, and @sfrias1. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.
:eye: P.S. In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.

Hi @aniketmitra1997
Every day I plan my day and time the night before and try to work according to it. To plan, I take around 20 minutes. Although it might be a bit more, it's worth it. I do it on trello.
I have my tasks divided into sections and then I just need to update those. For example, if I need to do something for this course, I keep it under a section with this name. This way, I know what I am working on. Writing for your reply at this time is also kinda planned the day before.  Also, I try to keep at least 2 hours for tasks like learning maths, working on projects, etc so that I can take notes and pay sufficient attention to the task. And for light works, I reserve less time.
I have been trying to plan like this for last 6-7 months. But I started being successful after I started allotting my time too. It keeps me more motivated and focused.

BUILT A SINGLE-LAYER NEURAL NETWORK
WHICH CLASSIFIES SHADES OF GREEN FROM
NON-SHADES OF GREEN, WITH CORE PYTHON
--------------------------------------
1. As almost always, I leveraged only python to build
a simple shades of green classifier. It worked well, but for
it's confusion with yellow. It was an icebreaker to
take a break from abstractions and implement the workings of NN from scratch. Snapshots below.

===========================================================================


A simple neural network built with core python, that classifies shades of green from non-shades of green.
This was built as a demonstration and exploration of the basic functionality of neural networks.

This demonstrates the inherent power of python and the amzing workings or artificial neural networks.

Sample Images
-------------
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/master/Green_shade_classifier/shot_of_images.png""/>

Code
----


from math import exp
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
def nn(features, weights):
#weights = [-1.7,1.8,-1.7]
bias = 1
# sigmoid activation function
def activation(x):
return (
1/(1 + exp(1-x))
)
# get inner product of features and weights
feature_weight_dot = sum(
[x*y for x,y in zip(features, weights)]
)
# add dot product of features and weight to bias
linear_result = feature_weight_dot + bias
return(bool(round(activation(linear_result),3)))
def load_images(list_of_image_paths, weights):
#
results = []
for path in list_of_image_paths:
image = Image.open(path)
arrays_from_image = np.array(image)
results.append((path, nn(arrays_from_image[25][0], weights)))
print(""\n\n----"", weights, ""\n-----"")
return results
img_paths = [""img{}.png"".format(i) for i in range(1,13)]
# Load images and classify them using different weights
for x,y in load_images(img_paths, [-1.6,1.8,-1.6]):
print(x.upper(), y)
for x,y in load_images(img_paths, [-1.7,1.8,-1.7]):
print(x.upper(), y)
for x,y in load_images(img_paths, [-1.8,1.8,-1.8]):
print(x.upper(), y)
How it works
------------

The load_images() function loads the image and gets the RGB values for its pixels. This system works on only homogenously coloured images. While this condition is satisfied, the load_images() function picks a pixel's RGB, and serves it as input to the neural network, with a specified array of corresponding weights. The bias is always 1. 

The summation of the bias and the inner product of the RGB features and weights, are passed through a sigmoid activation function and a boolean equivalent of the output is returned. `True` is returned if the image is a shade of green, and `False` is returned if it is not.


Outcomes and Performance
------------------------

1. Using weights [-1.6,1.8,-1.6]


[-1.6, 1.8, -1.6]
==================
[x] IMG1.PNG True
[x] IMG2.PNG True
[x] IMG3.PNG True
[x] IMG4.PNG False
[x] IMG5.PNG False
[ ] IMG6.PNG True
[x] IMG7.PNG False
[x] IMG8.PNG False
[x] IMG9.PNG True
[x] IMG10.PNG False
[x] IMG11.PNG True
[x] IMG12.PNG True
<img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/master/Green_shade_classifier/shot_of_images.png""/>


2. Using weights [-1.7,1.8,-1.7]


[-1.7, 1.8, -1.7]
==================
[x] IMG1.PNG True
[x] IMG2.PNG True
[x] IMG3.PNG True
[x] IMG4.PNG False
[x] IMG5.PNG False
[ ] IMG6.PNG True
[x] IMG7.PNG False
[x] IMG8.PNG False
[x] IMG9.PNG True
[x] IMG10.PNG False
[ ] IMG11.PNG False
[ ] IMG12.PNG False
The weights `[-1.6, 1.8, -1.6]` produced the best classification.


Conclusion
----------

- But for the trouble with IMG6.PNG, the neural network did great classifying shades of green from the sample images.
- Changing the weights changed the classification and this demonstrates the refinement that is automatically achieved using pytorch's autograd and backpropagation.
- Neural networks are amazing!

The versions of those two datasets used in this project will include many more features and has not been pre-cleaned. You are also free to choose whatever approach you'd like to analyzing the data rather than follow pre-determined steps.

*Day 5:*
Ok, I post a quick update for yesterday. Sorry that I'm late, but here is my work for the MLND:https://github.com/nicolas0dupuy/Dreem_data_challenge/blob/master/Report.ipynb
You can find the introduction of my Capstone report. I am taking a Kaggle-like challenge that I discuss here. This is an interesting topic about a French startup producing headbands to improve your sleep (if you sleep of course  )
I've also begun to present and discuss the data. If you want to run the notebook (only few cells for now), you'll have to download the database from the challenge website because it's quite big (a few GBs).
I won't blame you for not downloading it  but I would appreciate any honest feedback. Especially, I'm far from being fluent in English, so native people, or anybody better than me (most of you probably), I will deeply appreciate your comments!
I encourage my fiends @tumi_molamu and @mary.romanenko with a special thanks for her answer from yesterday. You really made me save a lot of time because I was going to reinvent the command you gave me by creating my custom layers, including setting weights manually and setting training parameters to false... You can imagine how many mistakes I avoided!
Ok, I'll produce the github file for the challenge later, promise, but I must keep on working `

""## I. Definitions\n"",
""### Project Overview\n"",
""\n"",
""Dreem is a french startup which specialized in sleep assistance products. One of its key product is a headband, gathering informations through sensors (electroencephalography electrods, accelerometer and pulseoximeter), and that also can send sounds using bone conduction. The understanding of those data is of paramount importance to determine the action that has to be done by the headband such as producing noise (called pink noise) at a particular moment of the sleep to enhance its quality. <br>\n"",
""To improve its headband efficiency, Dreem has recently launched an open challenge through the Challenge Data website of the ENS (École Normale Supérieure) https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/10/ . ENS is one of the highest school in France for scientific research and its DATA team created this Kaggle-like website for educational purposes. In this one, Dreem provide us with a huge dataset (261.634 labeled examples) and a blind dataset for evaluation. Each training example contains a time series, numerical and categorical data coming from user sleeps. The provided database does not contain any missing value. In the examples The time series consists of an EEG (electroencephalogram) for 10 seconds, and the corresponding label tells us if the next second following this 10 seconds interval a slow oscillation - characteristic of deep sleep - begins or not, and if yes, if it is of low or high amplitude (3 categorical labels).\n"",
""\n"",
""### Problem Statement\n"",
""\n"",
""This challenge consists in a classification of instantaneaous human sleep states in three categories. Each example contains :\n"",
""- a time series (1250 values),\n"",
""- 10 numerical data,\n"",
""- one categorical data. \n"",
""\n"",
""The time series is expected to have a central role in this problem. Its presence suggests to employ deep learning models with convolutional layers or recurrent layers. The other features should, however, not be neglected. A deep learning model with two branches, one dealing with the time series, one dealing with the remaining features, can be taken in consideration. The two branches would further be merged and followed by dense layers leading to the output prediction.\n"",
""\n"",
""The data analysis has to be carefully done, as the provided dataset is unbalanced between the three classes. Furthermore the three classes contains some different degree of similarity between them. Indeed those classes consist in :\n"",
""- no slow oscillation begins the next second,\n"",
""- a slow oscillation of low amplitude begins,\n"",
""- a slow oscillation of high amplitude begins.\n"",
""High and low are defined with respect with the mean amplitude of slow oscillations measured on the whole record. <br>\n"",
""Thus we can see that the two later categories contain a relative degree of similarity in that they both characterize the presence of a slow oscillation starting.\n"",
""\n"",
""The presence of a categorical data, which contains actually two categories, suggests that a preliminary study can be done by a simple hand computation of inferencies to determine the most likely output classe for each of those known categories. This will provide a lower bound for the expected accuracy of tested models.\n"",
""\n"",
""An important point to take into account is the nondeterministic nature of the problem. Indeed, it is plausible to assume that a given state can have different outcomes. If we could exactly reproduce the sleep state from a given training example in another individual, it is not certain that it would give the same outcome as this outcome may be affected by external parameters that we do not have access too (for instance, we do not know if the outcome is influenced by the circadian rythm, by the environnement, lights and sounds...). Therefore we should not expect the best theoretical accuracy a model could reach to be of 100%.\n"",
""\n"",
""There would then be two goals for this project :\n"",
""- the first will be to find a model providing the best accuracy, which is the metric required for the Dreem challenge,\n"",
""- the second will be an understanding of the behaviour of the outcomes depending on the features, with the idea of finding patterns, possibly hidden, leading to different probabilistic behaviours of the outcomes.\n"",
""\n"",
""### Metrics and Performance Evaluation\n"",
""\n"",
""In order to evaluate the performance of the tested models, two tools will be used :\n"",
""- accuracy over the developpement set (and validation set for the final model),\n"",
""- confusion matrices.\n"",
""\n"",
""The accuracy is the metric required for the challenge. Its evaluation over a fixed developpement set will allow to compare the performance of different models. Only one final model will be evaluated over the validation set to avoid indirect overfitting. <br>\n"",
""The accuracy provides however only few informations, and studying confusion matrices gives us more information about how the examples are classified or misclassified. Indeed, confusion matrices are defined by their entries:\n"",
""\n"",
""<font size=4>$$a_{i,j} = \\# (Number\\ of\\ example\\ of\\ label\\ i\\ predicted\\ as\\ label\\ j) $$</font>\n"",
""\n"",
""Those informations are useful because we can see for which class the model is most likely wrong, and if the two classes characterizing the beginning of a new slow oscillation, of low or high amplitude, confuse the model.""

I decided to take a rest from programming and do something else:
- I have registered a domain and I have made a website but with just web constructor that I love.
- Constructor caught Grammarly javascript and site was a Grammarly horror.
- The website that I created http://www.andreiliphd.com with a focus on a remote deep learning job. It is my personal page.
- Today I have just received an email from leading Russian IT company to consider the opportunities at this company.
- The problem that I am facing is that I can't walk far. I am exhausted after a short walk. Not sure that my salary will be enough to cover the center of the city flat rent.
- I am planning to continue developing pytorchboard called Carrot.
- The problem that I am facing is that UI split into two files and ids are not visible from the main page callbacks. I am going to fix that.Remote engineer fo your deep learning project.

Day 14/60:
Today was a roller coaster ride. Ran into some troubles with the dataset for my project. So, unwillingly, I had to make changes to the original dataset and the labels. Here is my progress for the day:
1. Worked on some federated learning concepts. Re-watched the course videos on PySyft from Federated Learning section. In total, spent an hour on the course content.
2. Ran into a hiccup on my Human Pose Estimation project. The images were of different sizes. So, I brought them all to the same dimensions and adjusted labels accordingly.
In the end, I made the changes successfully and tomorrow, I can proceed on generating confidence maps for my project (I was supposed to do them today, but such is life).
No images worth showing today. But, here is my repository for #60daysofudacity: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EGQaIWvp_rdgPaKlRDsUKvgU1GsI4wMO33B8maKWa60/edit?usp=sharing

@nesreensada For the varying noise part, like Andrew Trask mentions it is indeed a bit tricky. I referred to this blog here for the first time : https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-differential-privacy-85ce191e198a
It shows the probability of the coin flip in a graphical manner. And even I'll be revising these lessons again and  again to get a good hold over it eventually. Let know if it helps!

Day 12: I understand that external MOOCs do not count towards participation points to this 60 days challenge. Nonetheless, I will just report that I spent the day working on my MITx 6.86 Machine Learning with Python - From Linear Models to Deep Learning. Today, I completed the lectures on non-linear classifiers where the concept of kernel functions are introduced.  This is an upgrade on the perceptron algorithm that was introduced initially and now we update the alpha which is the number of mistakes instead of the weights of the classifier. I completed 1/4 of the homework due on Saturday. Also, there is a rigorous programming assignment on MNIST where there are many functions to be written. I still needed to research on Pyspark functions because there is a fairly complex feature table I have to create for the Quantum Black Hackathon challenge. The silver lining is that I completed one table using Pyspark SQL yesterday.

Day 13:
Milestone:
Finished lesson 1 of Introduction to Neural Networks from Intro to Deep Learning Udacity Course.
Learnings:
1. In creating neural networks, we'll err on the side of the complicated model and then we'll apply certain techniques to prevent overfitting. This is different from what I conceived as the right way to build models by starting at the simple solution and going up from there.
2. That L1 can be used for feature selection since that technique creates sparse matrix that turns unimportant predictors into zeros.
3. That L2 regularization tends to be efficient in model training since it sums of squares conservatively and homogeneously preserve the weights instead of getting zero lambda for suspected predictors with low predictive power.https://github.com/ArseniusNott/60DaysofUdacity#day-13#60daysofudacityTracking my progress in 60 Days of Udacity Challenge from Secure and Private AI CourseLast updated5 minutes ago

Great @sarahhelena.barmer! Compiling the sources for PyTorch and PySyft gave me some headaches, make sure to clone PyTorch v1.0.0  from source and use Python >3.6.
Latest version of Raspbian “Buster” comes with Python 3.7 preinstalled, so you can skip Python 3 installation if you are using that one

Day 8
Learned about dropout. At first it seemed to me like a funny technique, which nobody knows why works, but it does. But the ""intuition"" titled videos of Andrew NG always clarifies the remaining confusions, and loved the idea of drop out. How an algorithm shouldn't take any unit in layer for granted.

For days that you have already completed, if you can find your corresponding slack posts for them,  just copy paste those in the repository. If you are unable to find your previous posts in slack, then you can start posting updates in the repository from your current day (in that case your repository will not start from Day 1, don’t worry, it is acceptable.)  :bananadance::bananadance:*I am already maintaining such a record, do I need to create another?* :thinking_face:
No! If you have already been maintaining such a record, you need not make another. But make sure that it is shareable with us and keep posting updates in it for your remaining days of the challenge. :yay: :yay:Second One*Creation of New Channels - #channel_request*

Day 9 of #60daysofudacity: Progressing to the end of lesson 5. Set up reminders for virtual meetups with my study groups for tomorrow and day after. Read a few online articles on Secure and Private AI, gave me a lot to think about especially with reference to mass data collection schemes. Progress was a little lesser than usual today, as some sudden work came up in between. Hope to make up tomorrow.

Please keep being positive  Nobody knows how qualification works. Do what is good for you, recover and enjoy a nice country because you didn't have 12 hours of flight to let a sickness do that to you, and for the time zone.... you worry about it ?

@manishajhunjhunwala7 GUI cool. Try Kivy. It's very simple and you can focus on programming rather than understanding why it is not working. What you see is what you get, not tkinter maze.

Day 14:
1. Read research paper on Adam optimizer needs another reread. It's very interesting because the learning rate in the gradient update statement auto adjusts (decreases and increases) in Adam so there's no need of variable learning rate there.
Also it is dependent on the current level of noise (Signal to noise ratio). It achieves this by calculating the weighted average and weighted variance of the gradients of parameters. So just by tuning alpha, beta1,beta2 and € parameters we get an optimizer that converges faster and proper
2. Implemented Adam optimizer on Mnist dataset to see how my results are wrt to the research paper. Got a loss of 0.3something (a bit higher than the paper)
Hope to implement Adam from scratch soon
3. Attended a webinar by Intel ai developer Michael zephyr on reinforcement learning

Day 9 and 10
#60daysofudacity
1. I was unable to perform any coding but both days were interesting and exciting.
2. I was at NITI Aayog, premiere think tank of Govt of India, representing one of the leading non-profits of India.
3. Theme of the meet was to empower all the implementation partners of Atal Innovation Mission (Read more about Atal Innovation Mission at www.aim.gov.in) in order to implement Teacher Training program for Atal Tinkering Labs across India.
4. One of the major discussion point was to how to introduce Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence at School Education Level as formal subject as well as project based to solve local/community/civic problems.
5. It was great to present about how Python and Python based frameworks can help introduce programming on ML and Mathematical Concepts behind it.
6. Atal Tinkering Labs, school maker space, might introduce AI or ML as essential aspect of tinkering lab and projects coming out of it.
Happy to lead this entire effort at my organization and now probably at National Level.
7. These efforts might lead to some interesting Machine Learning projects from students getting ideated and prototyped.
7. Happy to practice what I wrote in my SOP for this scholarship.
9. Also brainstormed applications of AI in the field of Intellectual Property Rights.
This might become an interesting case study for the developing countries like India on how to propel digital efforts across the country and build more Intellectual Propert.
(I'm talking about WIPO dataset of Global Innovation Index.)

Day 1(Day 10): I spent the last few daysin northern Sweden without any Wifi/cell phone reception, so I had to skip a few days. This means obviously that I am out of the challenge(there are only ~50 days left), but I will still keep on posting. The project of the scraper I mentioned is close to my heart, as it will help my friends at work very much. It is a great feeling to be able to do something that has a real impact in this world, even just a small one. I wasn't idle in those last few days! I put a ton of papers and books on AI and differential privacy on my ebook reader and started sjetching out how I will build my NN scraper. Atm I prefer going the way of renderinv the Email and then using a (or maybe several) CNN to extract the needed information.

Day 13 I continued reading the [GEN paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) and saw that they were mentioning a lot the keyword minmax. Because of the frequency of repetition I assumed that it was something elementary that I should know, so what started being a curiosity, ended being a whole adventure, haha. So I read about the algorithm and watched:
+ [Search: Games, Minimax, and Alpha-Beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik)
+ [Algorithms Explained – minimax and alpha-beta pruning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI) I finished lesson 6 today, wahoo! Finally my PATE analysis is complete. I wished actually more information about it in the lesson, but still could practice again some MLP concepts with PyTorch and also how to visualize stuff in Python (I am really used to R and can argue that for visuarlization purposes it is way better #changeMyMind). I started finally with federated learning  It sounds like a really, reaaaally powerful tool. Looking forward to see more of it... but I guess that will happen tomorrow

It vastly simplifies manipulating and crunching vectors and matrices. Some of python’s leading package rely on NumPy as a fundamental piece of their infrastructure (examples include scikit-learn, SciPy, pandas, and tensorflow). Beyond the ability to slice and dice numeric data, mastering numpy will give you an edge when dealing and debugging with advanced usecases in these libraries. In this post, we’ll look at some of the main ways to use NumPy and how it can represent different types of data (tables, images, text…etc) before we an serve them to machine learning models.

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the *#60daysofudacity Challenge*. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the *#60daysofudacity* channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge. 
*Stay Udacious! :audacious_and_humble:*

[2] Creating the data set from the training data using torch vision.
[3] Working in some potentially architectures.
*What I learn:*
Today I decided to take part in a Kagle competition. This competition is about creating a GAN model to generated dog images. To start, this data set is composed by a total of 20579 images. However, not all the images displays the targets (dogs). There are some samples where other labels are presents, like: persons, etc.  Also, it is very interesting to see how GAN’s can be applied to different problems.

Hey Guys,
Day 9 0f 60
Just a little about myself. I am a project manager at manufacturing plant in BC. It’s a bit of a busy day again today. I have been able to spent much time on programming for last couple of days due to busy schedule. But I do find time once a while between the work day to read upon recent tech developments. In particular to this challenge, I was reading up upon the  googles library TensorFlow and facebook’s pytorch. Both are equally good, but TensorFlow has is a big library than pytorch. It is definitely important to get acknowledge with both this libraries as you guys do your projects. This are the couple of articles that I read on TensorFlowhttps://www.tensorflow.org/federated/federated_learninghttps://www.developereconomics.com/tensorflow-vs-pytorch
Moving forward , I found that coursera’s TensorFlow specialization is a good place to start to get acquainted with this library. I am planning to schedule into my study schedule atleast for couple of hours per week. I think its excellent as we are all mostly close to end of lessons of the challenge and would begin to start doing our final project.
HAVE A GREAT DAY AHEAD EVERYONE#60daysofudacity #Privacy #MachineLearningWho hasn't heard about the battle between Facebook’s PyTorch and Google’s Tensorflow ? A quick search will reveal the intensity of this clash of frameworks.

#60daysofudacity
1. I was unable to perform any coding but both days were interesting and exciting.
2. I was at NITI Aayog, premiere think tank of Govt of India, representing one of the leading non-profits of India.
3. Theme of the meet was to empower all the implementation partners of Atal Innovation Mission (Read more about Atal Innovation Mission at www.aim.gov.in) in order to implement Teacher Training program for Atal Tinkering Labs across India.
4. One of the major discussion point was to how to introduce Computational Thinking and Artificial Intelligence at School Education Level as formal subject as well as project based to solve local/community/civic problems.
5. It was great to present about how Python and Python based frameworks can help introduce programming on ML and Mathematical Concepts behind it.
6. Atal Tinkering Labs, school maker space, might introduce AI or ML as essential aspect of tinkering lab and projects coming out of it.
Happy to lead this entire effort at my organization and now probably at National Level.
7. These efforts might lead to some interesting Machine Learning projects from students getting ideated and prototyped.
7. Happy to practice what I wrote in my SOP for this scholarship.
9. Also brainstormed applications of AI in the field of Intellectual Property Rights.
This might become an interesting case study for the developing countries like India on how to propel digital efforts across the country and build more Intellectual Propert.
(I'm talking about WIPO dataset of Global Innovation Index.)@akshit thanks for such an beautiful opportunity.

The image data augmentation technique can also be applied when making predictions with a fit model in order to allow the model to make predictions for multiple different versions of each image …this data-set contains over 1000 images of paddy plants and weeds.Using data from Digit Recognizer

 *DAY 13 of 60: July 10, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar I created my github repository to track my daily activities with photos for the #60daysofudacity pledge of the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge: https://github.com/jckuri/60daysofudacity I noticed I was one of the winners of the competition *Boom with the Basics*. Moderators selected my answer to the Question 3: What is a hyperparameter?https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CK78R6TBJ/p1562759109025700
To be honest, I will keep participating in *Boom with the Basics* even if I will lose one or many times. I love the rush of adrenaline provoked by exam-like questions for 1 intense hour. It reminds me of my experiences as a student of ESPOL and Georgia Institute of Technology. And it prepares me for the Ph.D. in machine learning I plan to study. I continue learning the Unix commands to handle github repositories. So, I will be able to track the progress of my final project. I watched some YouTube videos of Siraj Raval on style transfer and generative adversarial networks, aka GANs, in order to participate in the #sg_project-t-shirt competition: http://bit.ly/tshirt-project_spaic I created my first design for the #sg_project-t-shirt competition. Not exactly the proper use of style transfer and GANs. But it is Anakin Skywalker saying: ""I pledge myself to your teachings.#60daysofudacity""  I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @christian_tutiven, @gstavocevallos, @ssalvatierra777, @ruben.romo.gonzalez, @daviddavilahp, and @sfrias1. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity.
:eye: P.S. In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.

Day 15: Spending time to reflect on all the new information  I have absorbed Since starting this challenge 6 weeks ago.  My learning style to to go over the course to survey the challenge and map my current understanding to what I need to fill in and make stronger.  Then focus on those weak spots and update the overall understanding.  Growing slowly but surely.  Weak spots for me are: Advanced DL NN's and how to prepare and deploy a model to production.     Data prep and input functions.  Discerning how to select  models/systems and selecting privacy levels.  I understand all the concepts but I need experience implementing them beyond the lab environment.  The Cloud group #sg_work_using_gcp is looking at forming teams to focus on CV, DL and FL/DP.  I want to encourage @krisastern@katrine.chow@ash3ax@sanasaeed40994@sarahhelena.barmer@bharati.frnds@rumanubhardwaj@terwey2012@samuela.anastasi@adventuroussrv@shchheda@vimaayi@learn556@shashi.gharti #UdacityFacebookScholar #Udacity #Facebookai  I have been reading   https://youtu.be/LCD_vgf-xy4https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/04/another-10-free-must-see-courses-machine-learning-data-science.htmlHi and welcome to an Illustrated Guide to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).

*Day 11* 
- Almost done the second phase to read Generative Adversarial Nets paper, I really like the analogy that the authors use to describe a bit the minimax two-player game:
The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters, trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency.

Day 13:
1. Read ""A generic framework for privacy preserving deep learning""  paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.04017.pdf to better understanding PySyft. Interesting finding “the differentially private model spends about 30.0ms, which is a very reasonable overhead (+50%) for a feature like privacy.” +50% overhead in some domains is not acceptable.
2. Digging dipper into PySyft by exploring https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/master/examples/tutorials
3. Actively helping and promoting #math_help and #sg_dlstarguys
4. Continue studying Udacity course ""Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch"" https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188/ to improve my PyTorch capabilities and have fun generating magical images for t-shirt project

Besides computer vision, I've seen this one not related to deep learning, but I think I'll have a look at it after the MLNDhttps://eu.udacity.com/course/computational-photography--ud955

1. Secure and Private AI: Lecture 7 Federated Learning
(https://github.com/marofmar/60daysofudacity/blob/master/L7_10%2C11_Day13)
- Concept11. PointerChain Operations: remote_get()
- Studied more about ‘Garbage collection’, since the concept of it was not clearly understood yet.
- Watched video explanation from Siraj Raval which I found on PySyft readme page (https://youtu.be/39hNjnhY7cY)
- The video was only around 10min, but real helpful in even that shot time period. This helped me to clarify the goal of our project and also to overview the learning process of ours.

#60daysofudacity *Day 6*:
Ok, this morning I wanted to cry (actually I don't, I just say that to be dramatic). I made a model run the whole night. Very promising. But I'm on my capstone since too long and I did a lot of inattention mistakes. So, things not to do:
*Don't forget your activation functions* or it will be like having only one layer, split in many ones, but no more efficient (and I took time determining the 1d convolutional stacking for nothing...). Actually, Keras is clever and make the fusion alone, I think.
*Be careful that when you add a layer, it is linked to the right name* because if you write net2 = layers.MaxPooling(5)(net1) instead of net2 = layers.MaxPooling(5)(lstm1), and you had net1 defined before, it will just skip the lstm you wanted.
So this morning I woke up and my first reaction was ""Woao, already that many iterations! It's fast!"" of course, the lstm has been shut down and there was activation function missing :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
Ok, so of course I didn't obtain the expected improvement...
So now, I fixed the mistakes and the model makes 10minutes approximatively for each iteration.
During that time, I keep writing my capstone report, and I appreciate your feedback and advise:https://github.com/nicolas0dupuy/Dreem_data_challenge/blob/master/Report.ipynb
Next section will be the method parts describing neural network parts. I'm doing figures... It takes time, but I hope it will be valuable`

""Dreem is a french startup which specialized in sleep assistance products. One of its key product is a headband, gathering informations through sensors (electroencephalography electrods, accelerometer and pulseoximeter), and that also can send sounds using bone conduction. The understanding of those data is of paramount importance to determine the action that has to be done by the headband such as producing noise (called pink noise) at a particular moment of the sleep to enhance its quality. <br>\n"",
""To improve its headband efficiency, Dreem has recently launched an open challenge through the Challenge Data website of the ENS (École Normale Supérieure) https://challengedata.ens.fr/participants/challenges/10/ . ENS is one of the highest school in France for scientific research and its DATA team created this Kaggle-like website for educational purposes. In this one, Dreem provide us with a huge dataset (261.634 labeled examples) and a blind dataset for evaluation. Each training example contains a time series, numerical and categorical data coming from user sleeps. The provided database does not contain any missing value. In the examples The time series consists of an EEG (electroencephalogram) for 10 seconds, and the corresponding label tells us if the next second following this 10 seconds interval a slow oscillation - characteristic of deep sleep - begins or not, and if yes, if it is of low or high amplitude (3 categorical labels).\n"",
""\n"",
""### Problem Statement\n"",
""\n"",
""This challenge consists in a classification of instantaneaous human sleep states in three categories. Each example contains :\n"",
""- a time series (1250 values),\n"",
""- 10 numerical data,\n"",
""- one categorical data. \n"",
""\n"",
""The time series is expected to have a central role in this problem. Its presence suggests to employ deep learning models with convolutional layers or recurrent layers. The other features should, however, not be neglected. A deep learning model with two branches, one dealing with the time series, one dealing with the remaining features, can be taken in consideration. The two branches would further be merged and followed by dense layers leading to the output prediction.\n"",
""\n"",
""The data analysis has to be carefully done, as the provided dataset is unbalanced between the three classes. Furthermore the three classes contains some different degree of similarity between them. Indeed those classes consist in :\n"",
""- no slow oscillation begins the next second,\n"",
""- a slow oscillation of low amplitude begins,\n"",
""- a slow oscillation of high amplitude begins.\n"",
""High and low are defined with respect with the mean amplitude of slow oscillations measured on the whole record. <br>\n"",
""Thus we can see that the two later categories contain a relative degree of similarity in that they both characterize the presence of a slow oscillation starting.\n"",
""\n"",
""The presence of a categorical data, which contains actually two categories, suggests that a preliminary study can be done by a simple hand computation of inferencies to determine the most likely output classe for each of those known categories. This will provide a lower bound for the expected accuracy of tested models.\n"",
""\n"",
""An important point to take into account is the nondeterministic nature of the problem. Indeed, it is plausible to assume that a given state can have different outcomes. If we could exactly reproduce the sleep state from a given training example in another individual, it is not certain that it would give the same outcome as this outcome may be affected by external parameters that we do not have access too (for instance, we do not know if the outcome is influenced by the circadian rythm, by the environnement, lights and sounds...). Therefore we should not expect the best theoretical accuracy a model could reach to be of 100%.\n"",
""\n"",
""There would then be two goals for this project :\n"",
""- the first will be to find a model providing the best accuracy, which is the metric required for the Dreem challenge,\n"",
""- the second will be an understanding of the behaviour of the outcomes depending on the features, with the idea of finding patterns, possibly hidden, leading to different probabilistic behaviours of the outcomes.\n"",
""\n"",
""### Metrics and Performance Evaluation\n"",
""\n"",
""In order to evaluate the performance of the tested models, two tools will be used :\n"",
""- accuracy over the developpement set (and validation set for the final model),\n"",
""- confusion matrices.\n"",
""\n"",
""The accuracy is the metric required for the challenge. Its evaluation over a fixed developpement set will allow to compare the performance of different models. Only one final model will be evaluated over the validation set to avoid indirect overfitting. <br>\n"",
""The accuracy provides however only few informations, and studying confusion matrices gives us more information about how the examples are classified or misclassified. Indeed, confusion matrices are defined by their entries:\n"",
""\n"",
""<font size=4>$$a_{i,j} = \\# (Number\\ of\\ example\\ of\\ label\\ i\\ predicted\\ as\\ label\\ j) $$</font>\n"",
""\n"",
""Those informations are useful because we can see for which class the model is most likely wrong, and if the two classes characterizing the beginning of a new slow oscillation, of low or high amplitude, confuse the model.""

1. Completed revision of Federated learning section. Will move on to revising the second last section of the course tomorrow.
2. On my Human Pose Estimation project, generated confidence maps for the validation set. Could have done the same for the train set but I ran out of memory. Will use Google Colab for it.
This confidence map generation was tricky because I had to assign a confidence score to the location of a joint in the image. I wondered about just assigning 1 to that area but I still followed the original paper text and implemented it.
Today, I was hit by the consequences of having an underpowered machine for this task. I had to work around a lot of things to make sure my device was able to handle it. Still, I am more experienced today than I was yesterday and adversity was expected.

Day 15: wrapped up all lessons and started reading a paper about:"" SoK: Towards the Science of Security and Privacy in Machine Learning"" by Nicolas Papernot, Patrick McDaniel, Arunesh Sinha†, and Michael Wellman  Pennsylvania State University  University of Michigan. The paper trys to explore systematic the privacy problems which aren't a key focus in machine learning. I only got done with about ~30% but will finish the paper to increase my knowledge.

2. Completed my Cats vs Dogs Classifier, and results were interesting. All 5 epochs obtained accuracy above 98%, which is well above the recommended minimum 95%. The best results were obtained from Epoch n.5, which implies that further Epochs might be necessary to reach optimum results. For training and validation purposes, I used Google Colab (photos attached)
3. On #sg_portugal, we decided on our 1st cooperative Kaggle project. The dataset is local-based, which fits perfectly in our geographical focus (https://www.kaggle.com/pvlima/results-from-running-events-in-porto)
4. Bonus: Finally my Google Sheet with all posts for #60daysofudacity is up to date. Therefore, I'm adding it here from now on.
5. Bonus 2: And by filling up my Google Sheet, only now I realized I forgot to mention that on 8 July (Day 9 / 60) I participated in a Data Science Portugal Meetup at Deloitte Digital Porto.

• After completing the style transfer section, I decided to jump on the research paper and had met with some really new concepts there - Gram matrix Optim.lbfgs and some worthy manipulation techniques.
• Had implemented my own solution and put it on training, hope something good will come up at last.
• Gone through some of the articles on getting style transfer ready for some work.
• Finally completed the quiz and had to set everything on forms, will move to a more secure platform for the next quiz. #sg_novice-ai
• Turned back to module exploration and started exploring the torch.optim package.
• Came back to mathematical analysis and started exploring parameter estimation, density analysis and a posteriori estimation.
• Started with flask deployment strategy, getting my hands a bit rough with that!
• Still looking for a virtual meetup.
That's all for today! Haven't done that much! I'll try to scale myself up to a mark from this weekend.

Day 14:
Things I learned:-
1. The formal definition of Differential Privacy in mathematical terms
2. Laplacian & Gaussian noise
3. Epsilon and Delta, the two important parameters of DP
Implemented the above things.
And this finally marks the end of Lesson5-Local & Global DPhttps://github.com/TanishB/Facebook_Udacity/blob/master/04_LocalAndGlobalDP/local%20And%20global.ipynb`

""# Project: Local Differential Privacy\n"",
""\n"",
""As you can see, the basic sum query is not differentially private at all! In truth, differential privacy always requires a form of randomness added to the query. Let me show you what I mean.\n"",
""\n"",
""### Randomized Response (Local Differential Privacy)\n"",
""\n"",
""Let's say I have a group of people I wish to survey about a very taboo behavior which I think they will lie about (say, I want to know if they have ever committed a certain kind of crime). I'm not a policeman, I'm just trying to collect statistics to understand the higher level trend in society. So, how do we do this? One technique is to add randomness to each person's response by giving each person the following instructions (assuming I'm asking a simple yes/no question):\n"",
""\n"",
""- Flip a coin 2 times.\n"",
""- If the first coin flip is heads, answer honestly\n"",
""- If the first coin flip is tails, answer according to the second coin flip (heads for yes, tails for no)!\n"",
""\n"",
""Thus, each person is now protected with \""plausible deniability\"". If they answer \""Yes\"" to the question \""have you committed X crime?\"", then it might becasue they actually did, or it might be becasue they are answering according to a random coin flip. Each person has a high degree of protection. Furthermore, we can recover the underlying statistics with some accuracy, as the \""true statistics\"" are simply averaged with a 50% probability. Thus, if we collect a bunch of samples and it turns out that 60% of people answer yes, then we know that the TRUE distribution is actually centered around 70%, because 70% averaged wtih 50% (a coin flip) is 60% which is the result we obtained. \n"",
""\n"",
""However, it should be noted that, especially when we only have a few samples, this comes at the cost of accuracy. This tradeoff exists across all of Differential Privacy. The greater the privacy protection (plausible deniability) the less accurate the results. \n"",

Made notes on loading image data in PyTorchhttps://github.com/festusdrakon/60DaysOfUdacity/blob/master/IntroToDeepLearningWithPyTorch/IntroToPyTorch/016_LoadingImageData.py
Discussed how to make progess on our mini project with my study group @smogal95@munniomer@apoorva.k.patil@aarthialagammai21, all of whom I encourage to keep going strong the way we're going and work with me towards the successful completion of the program. :hero:
Special thanks to @krisastern for being my biggest source of support and strength in matters both technical and motivational #we'll broadly be covering how to load image data and use them to train neural nets

#reference vid: 

#to mimic full sized images as we would come across in real life problems, we'll work with a dataset of cat and dog photos from Kaggle

#compared to MNIST and Fashion MNIST, our images are now larger and much higher resolution, and in different shapes and sizes

#step 1 to using them is to load them in PyTorch; once they're loaded, we can train a network using these things


#ImageFolder expects the files and directories to be constructed in a manner such that each class has its own directory that stores images with unique identifiers/names

#The images are then labelled with the class taken from the directory name

#Link to labelled dataset split into training/test set: 

'''
Transforms

After loading data with ImageFolder, we'll have to define transforms.

E.g. if images are different sizes, we'll need them all to be the same size for training, so we'll have to either resize them
using transforms.Resize() or crop them with transforms.CenterCrop(), transforms.RandomResizedCrop(), etc. 

We'll also need to convert images to PyTorch tensors with transforms.ToTensor()

Typically we'll combine these transforms into a pipeline with transforms.Compose()

which will accept a list of transforms and runs them in sequence

Code for scaling, cropping and conversion to a tensor looks like the following:
'''

transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor()])

#After obtaining dataset from Image folder, we'll define our transforms and pass it to the data loader

*Day 15*
Couldn't do much work today since I was super busy and held up with college! (From 10am to 7pm!) And also had been to the betrothal ceremony of my friend's sister!
1. But I did manage to go through and finish the first chapter of Ian Goodfellow's deep learning!
2. Watched a few videos of week 3 of Andrew Ng's Machine learning course!
I encourage and tag @minassouane@munniomer@sankalpdayal5@hawk.praxs533@jenashubhangi20@aarthialagammai21 !

Day 15:
1. Implemented RNN on a toy dataset
So RNNs are basically
input + prev_hidden -> hidden
for word in sentences
output, hidden = RNN(word,hidden)
Then further into linear layers
What an interesting read!
Currently implemented RNN in pytorch, will implement it in numpy next from scratch tomorrow
2. Reading https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/ part 1
3. Reading grokking deep learnin
Implanted basic neural network from scratch. On chapter 3
I would further like to encourage @sfmajors373 And @santiago.marti67 To attempt the #60daysofudacity Challenge today!A machine learning craftsmanship blog.

Thank you @adventuroussrv
Every day I plan my day and time the night before and try to work according to it.
To plan, I take around 20 minutes. Although it might be a bit more, it's worth it. I do it on trello.
I have my tasks divided into sections and then I just need to update those. For example, if I need to do something for this course, I keep it under a section with this name. This way, I know what I am working on. Writing for your reply at this time is also kinda planned the day before. 
Also, I try to keep at least 2 hours for tasks like learning maths, working on projects, etc so that I can take notes and pay sufficient attention to the task. And for light works, I reserve less time.
I have been trying to plan like this for last 6-7 months. But I started being successful after I started allotting my time too. It keeps me more motivated and focused.
One more thing is - i block the sites I feel I am wasting my time on. Sometimes slack too.

Day #15 Invested two hours in learning CNN. Started lesson 5, completed 5.1-5.13. Constructed a network with two hidden layers, picked CrossEntropyLoss and SGD Optimizer, trained it for 20 epochs. Training loss dropped from 0.312 to 0.009. It was fun to tweak the architecture and see the output response. Filled in a survey form in one of my study group #sg_europeers and look forward to a virtual meetups with people in Europe! And participating the AMA session. Participated #sg_novice-ai

Day 14/60: #60daysofudacity:
After a very long day, today I was able to glance through the content briefly as well as read through the tons of slack messages I have been unable to read since yesterday when I was offline and at work till very late at Night. I am seriously waiting for this week to be over so I can spend much more quality time working on the course. (https://github.com/desh-woes/private-ai/blob/master/%2360DaysOfUdacity.md)#Introduction
This file is a documentation of my learning journey over a 60 days period in attempt to optimise my learning from the `Secure and Private AI` challenge course by Udacity. 

>**Challenge Start Date:** 27th June, 2019.

### Day 1:
**Update** — 27/06/2019
1. Today, I will be working on understanding the formulas presented in the #l4_loc_glob_diff_priv module. They are quite confusing and require a lot of time to understand.

### Day 2:
**Update** — 28/06/2019
1. It's about time for me to complete the segment on Local and global Differential privacy. The projects in this segment have been super interesting. From learning that functions such as the sum and mean functions are not differentially private to learning about data conditioned sensitivity. I am really enjoying this part of the course. #60daysofudacity

### Day 3:
**Update** — 29/06/2019
1. Continued working in the local and global differential Privacy section. Almost done
2. Revisited the concept of data conditioned Privacy

### Day 4:
**Update** — 30/06/2019
1. Haha. Thanks for the tag @sumanyurosha!. Today,
I am resting after a long week of working. Hoping to get back to work fully energized tomorrow.

### Day 5:
**Update** — 01/07/2019
1. As always, @sumanyurosha is here to keep me in check! Thank you very much. I was actually busy with other stuff and forgot to post my updates.
Day 5: #60daysofudacity
Today I completed the lesson 4 on local and global differential privacy and I am currently looking at resources shared by @hrmello to help understand the formula's shared in episode 7, 8, 9 of the lesson.

### Day 6:
**Update** — 02/07/2019
1. Today I revisited episode 7, 8, and 9 of the lesson on local and global differential privacy. I also studied @rishisridhar96’s notes on github regarding the formalization of differential privacy. Finally, I did a bit of digging into the Laplacian Distribution.

### Day 7:
**Update** — 03/07/2019
1. I am now working on Lesson 6 i.e #l5_diff_privacy_dl. Still struggling with some formulas as well as access to internet but I remain dedicated to the course. There's some interesting concepts on how to modify differential privacy for deep learning and I'm looking forward to further exploration.

I'd also like to encourage @sumanyurosha and @ynawal to share their updates.

### Day 8:
**Update** — 04/07/2019
1. Today I continued exploring how differential privacy can be applied to deep Learning. It's exciting how you can train multiple models separately and bring them together to label an entirely different dataset.

2. The pate analysis is a bit confusing though. I am not able to go very in-depth because of internet constraints but tomorrow hopefully I'd get internet and explore the pate analysis even further.

3. Today I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96 and @hrmello to share their updates if they have not already done so.

### Day 9:
**Update** — 05/07/2019
1. Today I took a step back to explore a library that is used a lot in the field of Machine learning in general. I explored numpy and numpy operations. I could definitely see a lot of similarities between the numpy vector operations and the vector operations that are carried out in tensors too.

    It is a good library for beginners like me in the program to explore.

2. I'd like to tag @rishisridhar96, @hrmello, @sumanyurosha, @ynawal, @ash3ax to keep going with this wave and share their learnings with the rest of us :sunglasses:

### Day 10:
**Update** — 06/07/2019
1. I dedicated today to learning from the slack Channels through answering questions and reading answers to the questions asked by others. I think they are very insightful to go through and there's definitely a lot to learn from helping others as a beginner.

2. I'd like to encourage @undasu, @seeratpal91, and @shivshankar.hc to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 11:
**Update** — 07/07/2019

Today was a light day for me, I had to get some rest in preparation for the new week. However, today I was still able to:

1. Go over some python data structures and algorithms, in preparation for an interview. Today, I covered Array, stacks and queues.

2. I also covered some of the content on Pate analysis. I cannot say I fully grasp it yet but it's coming along quite nicely.

I'd like to thank everyone who reminds me to keep up with the challenge and I'd also like to challenge

@workwithpurpose, @sumanyurosha and @hrmello to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 12:
**Update** — 08/07/2019
1. Today I did some transfer learning of my own.:joy:, I started to explore the tensor-flow course on Udacity to see how applicable the learnings from Pytorch are in tensor-flow. Surprisingly, they are not so different at all, the general concept and approach to building deep learning models are almost the same and it is refreshing to know how much knowledge can be transferred from this course to other courses.

2. I'd like to thank @workwithpurpose and @arkachkrbrty for the constant motivation and I'd like to motivate @sumanyurosha, @gogulaanand02, @ash3ax to keep sharing their updates.

### Day 13:
**Update** — 09/07/2019
1. Today I went through the archives to visit old responses to some questions asked about the lesson on differential privacy with deep learning.

2. I also created my personal repository for [daily]() updates

3. Finally, today I'd like to thank @Arka and @Anna Scott for reminding me to share my updates as well as I motivate @Artur Freitas Gonçalves, @Elimu Michael, to share their updates.

### Day 14:
**Update** - 11/07/2019
1. After a very long day, today I was able to glance throught the content breifly as well as read through the tons of slack mesages I have been unable to read since yesterday when I was offline and at work till very late at Night. I am seriously waiting for this week to be over so I can spend much more quality time working on the course.

Day 14
*Mentoring Kids in Machine Learning*
>> 1) Helped as a mentor for an artificial intelligence summer appcamp at the google office today :) 16 Girls from all backgrounds are participating at this great event by AppCamps. So much fun to see them working on their first machine learning models (image recognition). The team of 4 kids I mentor are building a great app to recognize different currency... more to come tomorrow 
2) Couldn’t attend the virtual meeting of #sg_caffeine_coders because of the mentoring but could join a study group anyway :) Looking forward to the NLP project now.
I encourage @sarahhelena.barmer@akadidas1@casabiancadenny@sauravkumarsct@smogal95@cclinc2005@prateek.sawhney97 🥳

*Important Information on #60daysofudacity Challenge* :60daysofudacitybadge:
Hi Everyone! Recently we have seen many posts where students are posting updates other than the allowed topics in the #60daysofudacity Challenge. While we love to read about them, it would be really awesome that you *stick to the allowed topics of the challenge* so that your update gets recorded.  *Some tips/rules that might prove to be helpful while taking part in the challenge:*
• Post your updates only in the purview of *Course Content, DL, CV or any other closely related topics* ONLY.
• Use the posting structure carefully *(i.e. Day 1:, Day 2:, Day 15: and so on)* and read it twice after posting because you will have just *one hour to edit* your response.
• Use your OWN TIMEZONE while making the update, as we will be using that only while evaluating them.
• You are more than welcome to post on any social platform you want, but posting your update in the #60daysofudacity channel is a requirement so that we can record it.
• OPTIONAL Encourage 2 other students to join the challenge by inviting them to this channel. While it's optional, but doing this will be really helpful for other students. 
I am sure following these will really help you make the most our of the challenge. 
*Stay Udacious! :audacious_and_humble:*

Day 14 Learned about garbage collection on PySyft and also saw the first example of federate learning with the toy example in the lesson 7. I completed reading the [GEN paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf) and watched a [Computerphile video about GEN in Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sw9r8CL98N0). The video was entertaining, but the paper was actually enough (although in the last minute of the video they mentioned something surprising!) Participated in the #ama_sessions Few days ago someone asked a question here about reading a paper and @carlo12david recommended a [video from Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI).

Attended the first day of Lisbon Machine Learning School 2019 (http://lxmls.it.pt/2019/?page_id=40), a fantastic bootcamp sponsered by several companies leading the way in Machine Learning and NLP in Portugal. I met many students and researchers from different corners of the world, it was quite inspiring to talk to them. The morning lectures was a deep dive into probability theory and linear algebra. And the afternoon lab was an introduction to python and the application of mathematics in python for machine learning. It was more challenging than I expected, but I am inspired and excited!! There was a lot of material to get through on the first lab, so I am spending tonight working through them.

*DAY 13 [21.7%] | 60* #60daysofudacity
[1] Having an interesting discussion with @pbiswas101b about research topics in machine learning.
[2] Training a baseline GAN model to generate dog images.
[3] Sending my initial submission for the Kaggle competition: Generative Dog Images.
[4] Planning on future improvements for the baseline model.
*What I learn:*
Today, I learned how convolutional neural networks can be applied to recognize sign language characters. It is interesting to see how convolutional networks models can achieve great accuracy in such tasks. Regarding the training of my GAN model, I noticed how the features (filters) can play an important role at the moment to generate quality images. In fact, applying variations can lead to more natural results. However, other aspects like the number of convolutional layers can also affect the learned representations. Therefore I think a gradual approach should be considered, where in each stage, a set of layers / features are added, until get a desired result according with the available  computational resources.

ACTIVITIES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### HIGHLIGHT: CONTINUED MATRIX TOOLS: THE SECOND MAJOR PROJECT FOR THE STREAK, ADDING UP TO VECTORKIT
1. Work continues on matrix tools: the sequel to VectorKit. Implemented
Matrix multiplication, Conjugate transposition, scalar multiplication, Hadamard Product,
Matrix Addition, Matrix Subtraction, Matrix-Vector Multiplication,
Generation of nxn identity matrix!
Link here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Matrixtools/matrixtools.py
2. Continued my second ""epoch"" through the course, locally:
Continually having fun with torch.
3. I met Laplace again...Haha...This time, not for 'Laplacian noise',
but for Laplace (or cofactor) expansion, for deriving the determinant
to be used for calculating the inverse of a matrix.

Day 15 , July 12 I worked on the RNN/LSTM project which I had started on AWS SageMaker to do sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Got stuck while testing it for deployment to a web page.  A ModelError is thrown. Hope I will be able to fix it, tomorrow.   I finished the last notebook task of lesson 4.  I continued working on lesson 5. 60% done 
And Amazon SageMaker is driving me nuts. :bunny-tired-overworked: I currently can only work with a CPU , although I had requested a limit increase for a GPU, before starting that project. Due to a backend error of AWS, that GPU does not get applied to my account  :bunny-tired-overworked:  Wasted more time by corresponding with AWS than time spent on the course.  :bunny-tired-overworked: I hope all of you made an easier progress, today!

#60daysofudacity #Day15
Finished the course lectures! Now for the final project. My objective is to train a face-tracking model using remote workers. I’ll distribute the data (images from the FDDB dataset) across multiple remote servers (I think I have some AWS credits saved up). Then from my local machine I’ll instantiate a fully convolutional model and use what we learned in the course to train without workers sharing data or model gradients with each other. I’ve started preparing a mission statement of sorts for this which can be found with the project itself on my github:

 *DAY 14 of 60: July 11, 2019* #60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar I found and watched this incredible video of Siraj Raval, which is quite relevant for the channel #sg_project-t-shirt
Generative Adversarial Networks for Style Transfer (LIVE) [1 hour] https://youtu.be/MgdAe-T8obE
And I shared it in many channels of this nanodegree. I continued programming the code of the machine learning system to deal with the medical dataset of the 2 diseases of the urinary system: *Inflammation of urinary bladder* and *Nephritis of renal pelvis origin*. In few days, I will share the code of my final project through an open github repository. At the beginning, I was hesitant to share my code, due to plagiarism. (Our Universities are so obsessed about plagiarism and teach such obsession.) But the point of #UdacityFacebookScholar is to help our classmates. So, I decided to open my source code to help my classmates understand better the concepts of this nanodegree. Here is how I changed my mind in this thread: https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJW72L5D2/p1562785075337700
And I will program my final project as a Jupyter notebook explaining in detail what I did, in order to educate the readers. I motivated my classmates from Ecuador and Spain in the channel #sg_ecuador: @christian_tutiven, @gstavocevallos, @ssalvatierra777, @ruben.romo.gonzalez, @daviddavilahp, and @sfrias1. I encouraged them to continue doing the activities of #UdacityFacebookScholar, specially the pledge #60daysofudacity. I also encouraged back my classmates from the world: @ikhushpatel, @sankalpdayal5, @r.pretelt16, @adventuroussrv, @preriec, @tsmedia.rj, and @paul.stancliffe. I updated my github repository to track my daily activities with photos for the #60daysofudacity pledge of the Secure and Private AI Scholarship Challenge: https://github.com/jckuri/60daysofudacity
I also posted my daily activities on the Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/secureandprivateai/
:eye: P.S. In July 5, 2019, I have finished to watch all the video lectures of this nanodegree. My overall progress is 100%. So, now I'm focused on the final project. And I will surely watch again some video lectures if I have problems with my final project.

@susanwangds I have been saving udacity credits for GPU. And we will try to make effective model by using more cost effective commands .. life using transform in place of replace in python. This will be more effective practice as we will have firm knowledge of library and in competitions also we will perform well. For Google Cloud. I will have to see what they give for free tier . Don't worry about it. I will figure out something when we start .just waiting for my college to resume so that I have access to high performance computing lab .

@kevinadg I did not do the 30 days challenge, but used GCP for my Data Engineering project. I liked GCP and the ease of deploying applications and using buckets for storing videos and launching pyspark etc. What was not so cool was unlike AWS which provides 1 year of free time, GCP gave a credit of $300 and that emptied so fast and I ended up paying $600. Please ensure that you keep an eye on this and also remove your project and all related objects when you are done. Good luck

There were many mathematical heavylifting in the exercises which gave a lot of rigorous grounding to the machine learning such as linear algebra, feature engineering and non-linear classifiers and kernel function. Hard work pays off and I got 100% for the homework. I also went to MIT Sloan school meetup for the Masters in Business Analytics program to learn how about the admission process into the program.

Day 14:
1. Having fun at #math_help and #sg_dlstarguys Helping to understand gradient descent. I have written a step by step explanation how derivative of sigmoid is calculated and all necessary formulas that are needed to solve that derivatives. Solution is available https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJSCX4WAZ/p1562910015226000
2. Almost done with the first four chapters of Udacity course Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188
3. Reading chapter 3 “Basic Techniques and Composition Theorem” of Synthia Dwork book The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy https://github.com/AceEviliano/Reading-Facebook-Secure-and-Private-AI-Scholarship/blob/master/privacybook.pdf
4. Encouraged @sfmajors373 and @tmallikarjuna111#60daysofudacity #UdacityFacebookScholar #deeplearning #ai #facebook #udacity*[SOLUTION] Did you ever wander how derivative of sigmoid is calculated?* Here it is. Step by step explained. I have also added all necessary formulas needed to calculate it. Give it a try!

Hey @terwey2012, I think you have to request AWS SageMaker GPU instance which is different than the normal AWS compute instances. Moreover, instead of waiting for limit increase, you can use ml.m4.4xlarge instance of AWS SageMaker, it's a lot faster and can get the job done in few minutes. You can also use ml.m4.xlarge for simple inferences or training.

Whoa! Amazon!! That's freaking crraaaaazy!  You know what's more crazy?  They paid $0 federal tax and they did this legally.  What's more beyond crazy is the treasury knew about this but didn't and couldn't do anything.
As always, it's not only one thing or one person, but it's the people underneath supporting the one thing/person behind the one thing/person benefitting, making a living through the system.
""The Treasury already has this information. We’re already looking for it, even talking as if we have it. Releasing it will mean standing up to a lot of corporate blowback, but so will any meaningful reform. All this particular reform needs is passing a law and publishing a file. If we want to make sure Amazon’s paying its fair share, that’s where we should start.""https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/1/19102713/amazon-tax-returns-federal-2020-election-warren-biden-sandersWe don’t really know how much Amazon pays in taxes — it’s time to find out

1. Secure and Private AI Challenge
- I googled the term ‘differential privacy GitHub’ and could find out many people and companies are exploring the technique for the better deep learning of their own, and also could see many of them were enrolled students of our Challenge (https://github.com/topics/differential-privacy?o=asc&s=forks)
- Out of the search results, deploying DP on CNN seemed pretty interesting, so I visited the repository and took a look (https://github.com/offthewallace/DP_CNN)
- The program was about implementing PATE(Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles) by using custom datasets and training CNN model on it.
- Wow, and I got to know about the repository Tensorflow holding, and the name of it is ‘Privacy’ and this contains research, tutorials, and the relevant codes for those. (https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy)
- And from the above, Tensorflow Privacy repository, took a look into ‘DP Logistic Regression on MNIST’ which was in the tutorials directory.
- Out of the different functions, tried to learn more about ‘lr_model_fn()’
- Hmmmm this is difficult to understand by far, but I am sure that I will get better and better!

Day 1/60 Read https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DeepChain%3A-Auditable-and-Privacy-Preserving-Deep-Weng-Weng/07f229cc6e5b80fc8ffbbb3e4db85142466f55a9Deep learning technology has been evaluated to achieve the high-accuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms in a variety of AI tasks. Its popularity draws security researchers’ attention to the topic of privacy-preserving deep learning, in which neither training data nor model is expected to be exposed. Recently, federated learning becomes a promising way where multi-parties upload local gradients and a server updates parameters with collected gradients, in which the privacy issue has been discussed widely. In this paper, we explore additional security issues in this setting, not merely the privacy. First, we consider that the general assumption of honest-but-curious server is problematic, and the malicious server may break privacy. Second, the malicious server or participants may damage the correctness of training, such as incorrect gradient collecting and parameter updating. Third, we indicate that federate learning lacks incentives, since privacy and financial considerations may prevent distrustful parties from collaborative training. To address the aforementioned issues, we introduce a value-driven incentive mechanism based on Blockchain. Adapted to this incentive setting, we migrate the malicious threats from server and participants, and guarantee the privacy and public auditability. Thus, we propose to present DeepChain which gives distrustful parties incentives to participate in privacy-preserving training, share gradients and update parameters correctly, and accomplish iterative training with a win-win result. At last, we give an implementation prototype for DeepChain by integrating deep learning module with a blockchain development platform. We evaluate it in terms of encryption performance and training accuracy, which demonstrates the feasibility of DeepChain.

Today, I spent the whole time on my Pose Estimation Project. Had some troubles with my hardware limitations. But these limitations forced me to work around them and learn how to optimize the code. So, here is my progress for today:
-Found that generating Confidence maps and Parts Affinity Fields for the whole training set at once is not feasible. Hence, modified the code to generate them on the fly for batches of data. The Parts Affinity Fields generation is still incomplete. I needed to calculate all the intermediate limb points between 2 joints. So, I used Bressenham Line Drawing algorithm to find out intermediate points. Will complete the Parts Affinity Fields section tomorrow and start working on the model tomorrow too.

Day 13: Varying the amount of noise
- https://60daysofudacity.blogspot.com/2019/07/day-13-varying-amount-of-noise.html
- Expectation is that with smaller size of the dataset, adding more noise will make the difference between true dataset and sk_result is bigger. However, when the dataset is bigger, adding more noise will not make the difference between true dataset ans sk_result not as bigger as smaller dataset.
- The result shows that for true dataset (without noise) > 0.5, increasing the first coin flipped will increase the with noise percentage. While for true datase < 0.5, increasing the first coin flipped will decrease the with noise percentage. It makes sense since the true dataset below 0.5, the with noise will move towards the mean of the true dataset. It also work for the true datase above 0.5, the with noise will move towards the mean of the true dataset.I watched the video and run the notebook, Expectation is that with smaller size of the dataset, adding more noise will make the dif...

*#60daysofudacity Day 16*
1. Had a walkthrough of an implementation of a sentiment prediction RNN model. In the process, reviewed crucial concepts necessary for every stage from data pre-processing, to content tokenization, to defining and completing the sentiment RNN model architecture, to training it then testing it, and finally onward to using inference to make a prediction based on the model trained. A lot of similarities is noted between this and the implementation of a CNN model in some computer vision application. Noted that the use of LSTM layers as a part of all recurrent layers in the network is ingenious, as it mimics the way humans learn.
2. Finished another phase in the data pre-processing stage for the Kaggle Blindness Detection competition used for Datasyfters study buddy group with @fridarode00. Now we have a set of tuples containing both the retina image as a tensor and its diabetic retinopathy severity label (an integer from 0 to 4). Also, tried out one-hot encoding for preparing the labels for potential deep learning use. https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection
3. Discussed with @indraneel.ghosh1998 and @rumanubhardwaj about task allocation for Kaggle Pneumothorax Segmentation group project. Have volunteered to take on the task of segmenting the chest x-rays determined by our trained classifier to have pneumothorax with Rumanu, which splits the team into two for better division-of-labor. https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation
Would like to encourage @ash3ax@susyjame@ragnagus@olivia.milgrom@agbugbaijeoma and my teammates as well as study buddy to keep up their excellent progress!Detect diabetic retinopathy to stop blindness before it's too lateIdentify Pneumothorax disease in chest x-rays

• Today I decided to work on the data visualisation because I'm kinda bad in that thing. As suggested by the @arkachkrbrty I've tried seaborn library and to be honest, it's amazing, I've done with ridge plots and worked on census data.
• Been reading swish activation functions' paper.
• Still working on the model deployment strategies with flask/python.
• Rolled out the first quiz on #sg_novice-ai related to neural networks. All the best to everyone who is sticking with the beast program!
• Understanding multi-crop technique for an extra edge on kaggle.

*Day 13* / 60 of #60daysofudacity (12 July 2019)
1. Watched videos from Concepts 1 to 6 from #l2_intro_diff_privacy. Preparing to work on the Project Demo in Section 8.
2. Learned concepts 1 to 10 from Lesson 5: ""Convolutional Neural Networks"" at Udacity's Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch course.
3. Also, I explored all optional resources available in Concept 2 ""Applications of CNNs"" from Lesson 5: ""Convolutional Neural Networks"" at Udacity's Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch course. I am impressed and inspired by the range of fields CNNs can positively impact, including Healthcare, self-driving vehicles, videogames or translation. (for example, the groundbreaking model by DeepMind on text-to-voice https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/ )This post presents WaveNet, a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms. We show that WaveNets are able to generate speech which mimics any human voice and which sounds more natural than the best existing Text-to-Speech systems, reducing the gap with human performance by over 50%. We also demonstrate that the same network can be used to synthesize other audio signals such as music, and present some striking samples of automatically generated piano pieces.

""# Tutorial: The Basic Tools of Private Deep Learning\n"",
""\n"",
""Welcome to PySyft's introductory tutorial for privacy preserving, decentralized deep learning. This series of notebooks is a step-by-step guide for you to get to know the new tools and techniques required for doing deep learning on secret/private data/models without centralizing them under one authority.\n"",
""\n"",
""**Scope:** Note that we'll not just be talking about how to decentralized / encrypt data, but we'll be addressing how PySyft can be used to help decentralize the entire ecosystem around data, even including the Databases where data is stored and queried, and the neural models which are used to extract information from data. As new extensions to PySyft are created, these notebooks will be extended with new tutorials to explain the new functionality.\n"",

""\n"",
""- Part 1: The Basic Tools of Private Deep Learning\n"",
""\n"",
""\n"",
""## Why Take This Tutorial?\n"",
""\n"",
""**1) A Competitive Career Advantage* - For the past 20 years, the digital revolution has made data more and more accessible in ever larger quantities as analog processes have become digitized. However, with new regulation such as [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/), enterprises are under pressure to have less freedom with how they use - and more importantly how they analyze - personal information. *Bottom Line:** Data Scientists aren't going to have access to as much data with \""old school\"" tools, but by learning the tools of Private Deep Learning, YOU can be ahead of this curve and have a competitive advantage in your career. \n"",
""\n"",
""**2) Entrepreneurial Opportunities** - There are a whole host of problems in society that Deep Learning can solve, but many of the most important haven't been explored because it would require access to incredibly sensitive information about people (consider using Deep Learning to help people with mental or relationship issues!). Thus, learning Private Deep Learning unlocks a whole host of new startup opportunities for you which were not previously available to others without these toolsets.\n"",
""\n"",
""**3) Social Good** - Deep Learning can be used to solve a wide variety of problems in the real world, but Deep Learning on *personal information* is Deep Learning about people, *for people*. Learning how to do Deep Learning on data you don't own represents more than a career or entrepreneurial opportunity, it is the opportunity to help solve some of the most personal and important problems in people's lives - and to do it at scale.\n"",
""\n"",
""## How do I get extra credit?\n"",
""\n"",
""- Star PySyft on GitHub! - [https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)\n"",
""- Make a Youtube video teaching this notebook!\n"",

*Mentoring: Building the App, using AI / Machine Learning to recognize coins on images*
>>Wow! This was such an amazing day  Don’t know what to say! The girls built an awesome app. Everything was working very well and the parents came to see the kids presenting their finalized projects. The app was working great and recognizing the fotos we took of the coins. Was hard to get good training Data - but we did it in the end! Great team work I would say. To sum it up: These girls will be great DEVS! Hopefully in AI  couldn’t be more happy!

Day 13  of #60daysofudacity 12th July 2018:
- Today has been a slightly slow progress comparatively.
- I just got assigned a gesture detection project based on hand tracking at my work, so spent most of my day looking up solutions related to that.
- Got this book to actually refine and revise my math concepts for better understanding different kinds of machine learning models as a part of my so-called ""Back to the Basics"" journey. (Also displaying my laptop skin which has an amazing quote by Steve Jobs) .

=======
ACTIVITIES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### HIGHLIGHT: BUILT A DOUBLE LAYER NEURAL NETWORK THAT DETECTS RED, GREEN, AND BLUE COLORS IN CORE PYTHON
1. Built a simple double layer neural network with a single hidden layer, input layer and output layer.
It detects shades of red, green, blue. It did pretty fine . More detailed documentation here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Red_Green_Blue_Classifier/RGB_Classifier.md
Code available here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Red_Green_Blue_Classifier/nn_in_py2.py
2. Work continues on matrix tools as usual:
Link here: https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Matrixtools/matrixtools.py
3. Also added an exposition on Softmax functions. https://github.com/ayivima/AI-SURFS/blob/master/Activation_Functions/SOFTMAX.md/

Made notes https://github.com/festusdrakon/60DaysOfUdacity/blob/master/IntroToDeepLearningWithPyTorch/IntroToPyTorch/017_DataAugmentation.py'''
Data Augmentation 

It is a common strategy to introduce randomness in the data itself while training neural nets

For examples, images can be randomly rotated, mirroed scaled and/or cropped during trining

This randomization helps network generalize as it sees the same images, but in different locations, with different sizes, in different orientations, etc.

We randomly rotate, scale, crop, and flip images in our defined transforms like so:
'''
train_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.RandomRotation(30), transforms.RandomResizedCrop(224), transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(), transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize([0.5, 0.5, 0.5], [0.5, 0.5, 0.5])])

'''
We'll also be typically normalizing images with transforms.Normalize 

We'll be passing a list of means and list of standard deviations, then the colot=r channels are normalized like so

input[channel] = (input[channel] - mean[channel]) / std[channel]

subtracting the mean centers the data around zero and dividing by std squishes the values to be between -1 and 1

Normalizing helps keep the network weights near zero, in turn making backpropagation more stable

Without normalization, networks tend to fail to learn
'''

'''
During testing, we'll be trying to use images that haven't been altered in ways other than normalizing

For validation/testing images, we'll typically be simply resizing and cropping
'''

#defining transforms for training data and testing data 

data_dir = 'Cat_Dog_data'

#define transforms for training and test data

train_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.RandomRotation(30), tranforms.RandomResizedCrop(224), transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(), transforms.ToTensor)])

test_transforms =transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(255), transforms.CenterCrop(224), transforms.ToTensor()])

#Pass transforms in here, then run the next cell to see how the transforms look
train_data = datasets.ImageFolder(data_dir + '/train', transform=train_transforms)
test_data = datasets.ImageFolder(data_dir + '/test', transform = test_transforms)

trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dat, batch_size=32)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=32)

#change b/w trainloader or testloader

data_iter = iter(testloader)

images, labels = next(data_iter)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 4), ncols=4)
for ii in range(4):
    ax = axes[ii]
    helper.imshow(images[ii], ax=ax, normalize=False)

Day 15 Finished the videos of lesson 7. It remains for me to do the final project, which I will start tomorrow . I really enjoyed Brendan McMahan’s interview and I had no idea he was kind of the “father” of federated learning! I also checked his publications and some of them are basically intertwined between DP and FL. However, I cannot get that excited to jump right into it. My main goal is to understand initially how DP works (by reading [Cynthia Dwork’s book](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf)) and then jump into federated learning, which is more one specific scenario where one could ensure privacy I reviewed how backpropagation works and I am studying the structure of multi layer percetprons, and radial basis networks. !!!!!! @labknr98, @sfmajors373, @alexdomla, @mary.romanenko, @ash3ax, @naraque173, @r.pretelt16, @aniketthomas27, @manishajhunjhunwala7, @jckuri, @gogulaanand02, @bhadreshpsavani, @ewotawa, @garg4.ag, and @arkachkrbrty

Made some progress in sec federated learning
Half way through the paper https://lnkd.in/deHFgBP it is about Bert - dst. Bert for dialogue state tracking.  It is revolutionary as we no longer need large domain based candidate dictionaries but rather Bert can use context from dialogue to infer the meaning .This blog post explains the sparse momentum algorithm and how it enables the fast training of sparse networks to dense performance levels — sparse learning.

Read a few articles on the internet regarding Word2Vec Models.https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/going-beyond-traditional-sentiment-analysis-technique-b9c91b313c07https://towardsdatascience.com/learn-word2vec-by-implementing-it-in-tensorflow-45641adaf2achttps://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-word2vec/https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-lstms-and-gru-s-a-step-by-step-explanation-44e9eb85bf21 Prepared a PPT for my talk on Word2Vec tomorrow.

It has symmetry, elegance, and grace - those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains it own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.” ~ Dune (1965) I find the concept of embeddings to be one of the most fascinating ideas in machine learning. If you’ve ever used Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa, Google Translate, or even smartphone keyboard with next-word prediction, then chances are you’ve benefitted from this idea that has become central to Natural Language Processing models. There has been quite a development over the last couple of decades in using embeddings for neural models (Recent developments include contextualized word embeddings leading to cutting-edge models like BERT and GPT2). Word2vec is a method to efficiently create word embeddings and has been around since 2013. But in addition to its utility as a word-embedding method, some of its concepts have been shown to be effective in creating recommendation engines and making sense of sequential data even in commercial, non-language tasks. Companies like Airbnb, Alibaba, Spotify, and Anghami have all benefitted from carving out this brilliant piece of machinery from the world of NLP and using it in production to empower a new breed of recommendation engines. In this post, we’ll go over the concept of embedding, and the mechanics of generating embeddings with word2vec. But let’s start with an example to get familiar with using vectors to represent things. Did you know that a list of five numbers (a vector) can represent so much about your personality?Hi and welcome to an Illustrated Guide to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).
