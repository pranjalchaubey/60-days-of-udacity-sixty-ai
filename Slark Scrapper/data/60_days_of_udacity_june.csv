@akshit if you can make all the memebers admin for a channel we can directly post out git commits in that channel through slack bot , I suppose you will look into this as we have #60daysofudacity

That's a good idea but if channel admins can delete the channel it'd be rather risky.

YAY! I have done my Lesson 1 #l2_intro_diff_privacy where I get a chance to meet Andrew on video. Through meeting with Andrew, I have learned more about data privacy and security.
Here's a summary of lesson 1:
Data Privacy has been a very important concern for government and companies these days. When doing AI in the real world you'll find that most datasets are siloed with large enterprises for two reasons:
1) First enterprises have a legal risk which prevents them from wanting their dataset outside their organization.
2)  Enterprises have a competitive advantage to hang onto large datasets collected from their customers.
Now, Scientist like ""Andrew"" are often extremely constrained in terms of the amount of data they have access to solve their problems.
This means that some of the most important and personal issues in society simply cannot be addressed with machine learning, because we do not have access to the proper training data. But by learning how to do machine learning that protects privacy, we can make a huge difference in humanity's ability to make progress, curing disease and who we are through our data. #60daysofudacity

Ok, then... Let's give it a try... Today for #60daysofudacity , I woke up and monitored my neural network which optimized during the night and scores around 51% of accuracy on the dev set  It looks not so good, but give it a chance! The best recent score in the challenge I'm taking is 53.8%, and I got almost that score with another model, and I'm trying another strategy 
See you later for the encouragement! Because I won't encourage 2 people randomly

Please have a look at the board and let me know your suggestions. Also, if I have missed any of the initiatives, let me know.

@ellyanalinden Didn't read yet, but checkout this https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1903.06464/With the tremendous growth in the number of scientific papers being published, searching for references while writing a scientific paper is a time-consuming process. A technique that could add a reference citation at the appropriate place in a sentence will be beneficial. In this perspective, context-aware citation recommendation has been researched upon for around two decades. Many researchers have utilized the text data called the context sentence, which surrounds the citation tag, and the metadata of the target paper to find the appropriate cited research. However, the lack of well-organized benchmarking datasets and no model that can attain high performance has made the research difficult.

Well all of you nice day, just thought I would let you all know,  @sol.vriksh, @arkachkrbrty and I are conducting reading sprints  and several scholars have joined. The main motto is to cover :
1. main text ""Algorithmic Foundations of Privacy""
2. Torch docs
3. and related (suggested) research material
Why this here and why now ? well as of now the #reading_paper_discuss channel seems to be for reading research material and so, but there are some of us who felt the basic text also covers a lot of breadth and is quiet involved by itself. It may not be possible for  all to do this alone while going through daily routines of work, office, college, etc. but as a community we can all pull up.
We will be conducting weekly quiz (starting this week) and other related activities, So want to join then just sign up here, looking forward to meet you all :https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeiI8RIMYWBAaZolKJciwv3tHDE4n0PElLYxhDBo2TBdvlgZg/viewform?usp=sf_link

Day 1 of #60daysofudacity  I learnt a lot about activation functions today as well as the nn Module in PyTorch. Here is just a short summary, your corrections are welcomed.
:torch_heart_big:Activation Functions--They basically introduce non-linearity to our network .They convert every input signal into an output signal so that it can be passed on to the next layer.Sigmoid Functions--Takes input signal and squashes it to a range between 0 and 1.However the problem is that they have the vanishing problem where for outputs close to 0 or 1 the slope of the gradient changes very slowly.TanH(Hyperbolic Tangent Function) --Squashes input value to a range between -1 and 1 and its output is zero centered.ReLU(Rectified Linear Unit) --This function rectifies the vanishing problem in TanH and Sigmoid. Only used for the hidden layers.Softmax Activation Function -Turns the input values into probabilities whose sum is equivalent to 1.Only used for output layer .

Day 1 (that started Monday night):
1) I have finished training a Word2Vec model from wikipedia data using tensorflow, after trying multiple loss functions and learning rates to have a better picture, I found out that nce_loss and random update of learning rate work the best to create analogies. The code started running Monday night locally using gpu and finished today morning when I was at work, just checked it via ssh.
2) For tonight: do the same with GloVe exploring the best analogies and if I find the best path today, I'll leave it training, hopefully will be done by tomorrow night.
3) Start implementing a Word2Vec with GloVe if time allows me.
4) Get back to Slack and try to figure out how I can find a study partner.

So I have worked on my robotics MATLAB Assignment today in it I have created a PD controller to control a quadrotor in 3D then generated  trajectories such that the quadrotor will navigate through all of the given waypoints, though my 1st trajectory was a helix trajectory its working fine but i am facing some problem with line trajectory :zany_face: actually in the assignment we were given a error threshold and line trajectory  error is just a bit more than given error threshold except this everything is working fine.

@krts18199 I can take the lead on the administrative stuff (setting up a virtual meetup, voting form for designs so folks can show participation, getting shirts available for order) if you'd like to take the lead on the GAN component. @akshit, anything else we should consider?
 
Maybe use the meetup to walk through the process; give folks two windows: (1) to submit designs, (2) to vote on designs; get t-shirts avaialble for order for the top n designs. What do you think?

*Day 1*
I'm participating to the Dreem challenge since few weeks, and doing it as my capstone for machine learning nanodegree.
So for this challenge, I realised today that I made a crazy mistake. I wanted to do a lstm model in Keras because there is a time series. I realised that my optimisation was fast, just because I forgot to connect my lstm layer to the rest of the model :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:  I fixed it today, and now it optimises much slower! I home it will give a better accuracy because tjis challenge is... really challenging!
Also, I browsed the Internet to find a thema where to apply privacy related deep learning. There are nice things to do with cardiology. I care about this topics too because I lost an uncle in my childhood because of an heart attack. It would be a revenge against the disease 
No lessons however for today. I have a little break

My #60daysofudacity Report | *DAY 1*
• I signed the pledge to engage with my 'Secure & Private AI Challenge' community for at least 30 minutes per day for the next 60 days.
• I have Completed Lesson 3: Introducing Differential Privacy
• Since I always love to learn from first principles, I’ve decided to quickly focus on learning the fundamentals of Deep Learning instead of just running through the lectures and codes. So, I started the Intro to Deep Learning with Pytorch course on Udacity here.

So here it is for #60daysofudacity:
1. Step 1 : Pledge Taken 
2. Step 2 : I completed L2(Introduction to PyTorch) & L3 (Differential Privacy) last week. However, I needed to setup  libraries to put L3 in practice and thats what I did today - Instructions for launching the exercise notebook  - took me an hour to get things ready in my virtual environment on ubuntu 
3. Step 3 : Posting here already 
4. STEP 4: I encourage @gossgowtham - who is planning to start this challenge tomorrow but @gossgowtham why not just dive in -let it be just the first course , I guarantee it wont take you more than 5 minutes , literally not more than 5 minutes ! - to start with first lesson ""Introduction to the Scholarship Challenge"" . Its just two simple slides and you are done. Remember that the challenge of #60daysofudacity  is in a streak and it starts today! So let it be your first step! So challenge accepted  ? Just start it today rather than tomorrow!
I also encourage @lola.vicente, I read about her busy schedule in #busy_or_overwhelmed . But @lola.vicente I just need your 5 minutes! Its a #60daysofudacity  and it has already begun! Just dive in - Just take first lecture to set yourself in motion! Setting yourself in motion is all what you need. Once you break that activation energy, you will be all set to go! But believe me there are lots of scholarly scholars here who share the same hectic routine as you but they have started putting in - so just trying to help you kick start  why dont you began today - You got this!

Hi guys. According to what I have read, this 60 days of code will require 30 minutes every single day.

*DAY 1*: Completed Lesson 1.1 and Lesson 1.2
Remembered to code in Python using Pytorch.
I'm in a group Slack with @cioloboc.florin and @calincan2000 and talked about the lesson 1.
We also wanted to come up with an idea for a project.
First of all, this #60daysofudacity challenge has made me want to learn all the course for 60 days.
For this, I have to make a serious plan. So I looked to see how many lessons I have and how many sub-chapters:
Lesson 1 has 2 subchapters
Lesson 2 has 27 subchapters
Lesson 3 has 8 subchapters
Lesson 4 has 7 subchapters
Lesson 5 has 9 subchapters
Lesson 6 has 8 subchapters
Lesson 7 has 13 subchapters
Lesson 8 has 9 subchapters
Lesson 9 has 9 subchapters
Lesson 10 has 1 subchapter
In total there are 10 lessons and 93 subchapters.
To know how many subchapters to allocate for each day, I will calculate 93 subchapters / 60 days = 1.55 (subchapters / day)
That means I will make two subchapters every day.
In my case, even though I have gone through some lessons to this day, I have just started the course again and have gone through Lesson 1.1 and Lesson 1.2
I hope my learning plan will attract as many colleagues as possible to do like me.
Even though I'm on holiday, I still took my laptop with me so I can learn the course. I put some pictures of the holidays.

I want to thank you @sarahhelena.barmer and @jenashubhangi20 for your encouragements ! You rock !   Pledge taken ! I chose 3 activities to take part in. I didn't check the ""Attend a meet-up"" one because I can't be sure I'll be able to attend one this summer   I went over what I already did in Lesson 2 today. Have not really studied the course these last 4 days, so I wanted to refresh my mind to continue tomorrow on a good start.
Planning to study from 2.16 to 2.20 tomorrow, so that way I'll have finished Lesson 2 by the week end (I know, I'm super fast ! x) ) I also prepared flashcards for tomorrow's *FLASHCARDS GAME* at #wmn_who_code@munniomer, Would you like to make a group for the Kaggle project you posted about ? I want to encourage @mikaelaysanchez and @munniomer  to join this challenge !

Resumed Lesson 4 and understood the difference between Data Conditioned sensitivity and Non-Data Conditioned sensitivity. Where the major difference lied in the fact that the later is based on the function applied and the potential range of the data and the former is based on the values in the database.
Spent a considerable amount of time trying to figure out the Differencing Attack project.
Started with Lesson 5. Got introduced to the concept Local and Global Differential privacy and the importance of noise.
I would love to group up with someone who is interested in forming a group. Thanks.

Glad to have taken the #60daysofudacity pledge. I’ve started taking a look at the Face Detection Data Set. My objective is to use Pytorch to build a face-tracking model. First step, pre-process data. Only had enough time today to get started reading in the annotations. As they say, “the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”
Thanks for the shoutout @d.pandey11585 ! Need this accountability in my life

Hey @fridarode00! First, congratulations for your progress  . Then second, your opinion about the sql summer camps interests me. How good is it? Is there something new compared to datacamp, for instance, or some innovative chapters? Or is it project and practice oriented?
I registered too, but with an opportunist behaviour because it is free (not very proud of that behaviour) and didn't begin it because I'm on too many things. I'd appreciate your opinion a lot

@nicolas0dupuy Three part answer. It is good. The kaggle learn has like 10 different free lessons. This is the SQL lesson that is  being enhanced by a live YouTube cast per the first three sessions. The videos are listed to watch later.  It is SQL but using kaggle notebook kernel that is connected to Google big query. Big query has large datasets that you can connect to with your kernel by adding it from the list of kaggle datasets. Cross listed showing what sets are big query connectable. So this can be used with the kaggle GPU to acquire datasets and splice them for train, test and validation sample batches.

Funny for me to read that because as a teacher, I motivate young students who dislike the chapter about derivatives by explaining them how important it is in artificial intelligence , mentioning the loss function without naming it, and telling that thanks to few formulae you can minimise it even if it amazingly big and complex, and at the minimum you have the best model. Now I can say that there are people all around the world learning derivatives for that

Hi @garg4.ag, I guess we can post at any time of the day - once we have completed our work for the day. We can also post if we have worked on something, but have not completed it (e.g. I have worked on the final project for lesson 8, but have not completed it today. I will continue tomorrow, but I can still post about it today.) But I totally agree about the questions and resources!

Day 2:
======
I.1. I read several times the link I found on the internet (that I put the link in day 1) about how to install pytorch + pysyft on a raspberry pi, of which here is the link again:https://blog.openmined.org/federated-learning-of-a-rnn-on-raspberry-pis/
to find out how they did it.
I.2. Then I gathered the material I needed. I have : 1 raspberry pi3B+ and 1 empty 64GB microsd card.
I.3. After that I looked on the internet to find out how to install raspbian (operating system for raspberry), I found this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBlxuf_LSCM
I.4. They used the software www.canakit.com/tools/sdformatter to format the microsd 32GB in FAT32.
the problem is that they use a microsd card of 32GB, however I have a microsd card of 64GB, the problem is that when we have a microsd size larger than 32Gb we can't format it into FAT32, to solve this problem I used the software Rufus to format it in Large FAT32 to be able to install raspbian.https://rufus.ie/
then I download raspbian in this linkhttps://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
I have the choice between NOOBS and Raspbian, I have chosen Raspbian, he took me to this website:https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
then I selected
(Raspbian Buster with desktop and recommended software:
Image with desktop and recommended software based on Debian Buster).
because the size of raspbian is 1.8 GB it will take me a long time to download it (around 7 hours ). So I'm going to download it right now.
II.1. I also learned a little more about Federated Learning by watching the videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJkY3ehX_MI

*#DAY 2:* Completed : Project -IV : https://github.com/souravs17031999/private-ai/blob/master/noise_and_without_noise_db_analysis.ipynb I learnt to implement local differential privacy in the database by adding noise to the input data and how it affects the statistics.Project - V : https://github.com/souravs17031999/private-ai/blob/master/random_noise_analysis_differential_private_ai.ipynb I learnt how to add random noise by adding bias to the coin toss algorithm and how it affects the statistics and observe the changes while i grow the size of dataset.
I learnt that the idea of differential privacy is to simply block or filter out the results which are unique for a individual in a sensitive dataset and allow and focus more onto learn about the general characteristics of the individuals which is visible across most of the datapoints in the dataset.
Moving onto Project for global differential privacy.

1. Formed a Kaggle group with @rumanubhardwaj and @indraneel.ghosh1998: https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-acr-pneumothorax-segmentation/team
2. Am reading up on the Kaggle competition in preparation for a first submission of our model.
3. Am planning to engage in another side project harnessing PyTorch and Deep Learning techniques that also incorporate MPC used in securing federated learning on a small grid/network. Currently contemplating project nature, code architecture, and server setup. Reckon my personal laptop is too limited to carry out a plan that is small-scaled while realistic enough compared to real life situations and also being education and fun. Expect to end up using either AWS or GCP in the network creation so that I could use WebSocketWorkers instead of VirtualWorkers: https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft/tree/dev/examples/tutorials/advanced/websockets-example-MNIST

    opt = optim.SGD(params=model.parameters(), lr=0.1)
    
    for iter in range(iterations):

            # send model to the data
            
            model = model.send(_data.location)

            # do normal training
            opt.zero_grad()

Day 2 : #60daysofudacity  Code or practice your program topics for 30 minutes everyday
So I completed lecture videos of  #l2_intro_diff_privacy  ""Introducing Differential Privacy"" Last Week but today when today, before moving on to practicing notebooks, I realized that I needed to recall. Hence I re-iterated through all videos and this time, I made notes of every lecture video to save time for future purposes  Now I am all set to began practicing!
So here are the notes I have extracted
Introducing Differential Privacy : #l2_intro_diff_privacy
Part 2 : Introduction -
q1. What is differential Privacy (DP) in DL?
a1. while handling sensisitive data - ensure that NN only learn what thet are supposed to learn
and what they are not
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part3  : What is DP in more detail
q1. how do you define a robust defination of privacy?
a1. Proposed by Cynthia Dwork -
Data holder claims to data subject that :
""You will not be affected, adversely or otherwise, by allowing your data to be used in any study or analysis, no matter what other studies, data sets or information sources, are available""
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 4: Can We Just Anonymize Data
q1. What does ""by allowing your data to be used in any study or analysis, no matter what other studies, data sets or information sources, are available"" actually imply ?
a1. The data holder itself did not indulge in any activity to release sensitive info but some other RELATED DATASET was released (NETFLIX EXAMPLE) and on the basis of some relation b/w two , sensitive information could be discovered. So to ensure privacy, data holder must also take care that neither he himself, neither a related dataset should disclose any personal/sensitive info
NETFLIX EXAMPLE
Example of DNA Study
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 5 : Introducing The Canonical Database
q1. How to define privacy in the context of an example database i.e while querying from it
a1. If the results retrieved by the query donot change upon removing ANY record from database, this means that person's privacy is not breached - if we are able to do this , then this means that privacy is ensured - that person wasn't leaking any statistical info in the query result
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 6 : Project Intro Build A Private Database In Python
Just a small explanation of project function - 5000 databases Engross yourself in the Community Initiatives. :inception:
Apart from that, I was engaged in following
1. @general - participated in quiz

Same goes for @annaunger78, I know it's overwhelming after successfully completing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, Congrats again!
Take some break or rest and then just at least 30 minutes a day can make a huge difference! Since the advent of differential privacy, a number of systems supporting differentially private data analyses have been implemented and deployed.

Okay, let me join the party as well! :party_mim_cat:
I have been struggling a lot in the past days because I will have some exams soon and I have panicked a lot during this whole semester. I have found some useful testimonials and advices at #busy_or_overwhelmed for how to manage my time and how to cope with the panic and stress when there are too many tasks at hand. In a way, I need to change a lot of things of my personal/work/student life to make it more productive and enjoyable. Since *habits* are developed through time, I will use this place as a journal of my trip and a way to share it to someone (if anyone actually gets to read this) in a way to motivate myself to keep going forward.
*Day One:* Took the pledge to join #60daysofudacity [5m]. Made a plan of how to deal with every dimension that I need to put in order in my life (yeah, 80% not relevant to this challenge but still…) [5h] Worked on notebook 3 and 4 from Lesson 2. [1h30m]
Hey, @sfmajors373, @dustin.gogoll, are you guys already on this train? Look forward to read about your progress! Tag me so I can find you here!

*Day 2/60!*
Today was one of this days we sometimes have to deal when we have so much to do and have no time to spend. However, I tried and I found some time to spend learning! I really like to understand things at a low level point of view, so, I started to get deeper into Pytorch and I learned a lot about how autograd and some other Pytorch components worked.
Also, I read some papers about differential privacy!
Hope you guys are doing great in this challenge!

Day 1
So it is my first day of challenge (I pledged to do it today). I managed to revise couple of previous notebooks (I had to take a break from the course due to exams on the University) and did further excercises in course for a little over 30 minutes, but I am exhausted after whole week of working and studying so it has to be enough for now.
I am still happy that I managed to do anything today  and I hope you all, guys ,are able to stick to the challenge.

*Day 2* #60daysofudacity
I started to code late in the evening. Late, because of the heat levels in France (35°C in June, for me it's very hot... Don't laugh  ) so during the day, I only watched videos on my mobile phone.
So here am I again on my LSTM for my *challenge about sleep state recognition*. Today I decided to make it simpler than before. My data are a mix of categorical, numerical, and a time series. Numerical data seem to orient the classification in some preferred direction but without any certainty (from data visualization) and I decided to focus on the time series with my LSTM alone, removing a further concatenate layer, to make a building block and use it later to connect a bottleneck taking all data into account.
Otherwise, I tried to create a *meetup in Paris *, which is really challenging due to my geeky personality. Organizing things, especially with people, have always been difficult for me. I'm more in my comfort zone with my books, learning or teaching, or practicing individual sports. So, me attending to organize a meetup... this is something!
Also, I browse some developer communities around sports smartwatches (Polar actually. Love those ones) because I want to do something with heart sensors and federated learning to improve their efficiency

*Day 2:*
*What I've Done*: I started to watch deep lizard's neural network with pytorch videos on youtube along side with the udacity course.
*What I learned*: When creating tensors, Torch.tensor() is the go to options for everyday use, if we are tuning our code for performance, torch.as_tensor() is the best to use because it shares memory from original data. I also learned that If we're writing code from scratch, dont focus first on performance, focus on code that is readable and correct. Once this is achieved, we can review our code for performance issue, the reason is we dont want performance the reason that our code is incorrect or complex and hard to debug.

Day: 2
- since I am not comfortable with my understanding with Pytorch, I revisited lesson 2: Deep learning with Pytorch.
- Also spend time with lesson 2 of this free course : Intro to Deeplearning with Pytorch. https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud188, I would recommend this to others to are new with Pytorch just like me.
- I posted question on Facebook group looking for people to come from center of USA.

a. read GAN paper (with important proofs, here they have explained very well)https://srome.github.io/An-Annotated-Proof-of-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-with-Implementation-Notes/
b. implementing GAN and doing minor debugs.The preferred illustration of Generative Adversarial Networks (which seems indoctrinated at this point like Bob, Alice and Eve for cryptography) is the scenario of counterfitting money. The Generator is a counterfits money and the Discriminator is supposed to discriminate between real and fake dollars. As the Generator gets better, the Discriminator has to improve also. This implies a dual training scheme where each model tries to one up the other (i.e. through additional learning). In this post, we will explore the proof from the original paper and demonstrate a typical implementation.

Something amazing (maybe?) will happen :charmander_dancing:!
3.- She (@ursulaperezr) motivates to me to start this challenge and share with all of you that I will be speaker at Europython in Switzerland next month (one of the biggest conference about python :python::nerd_face:). I am a bit scared as you can figure out !

@yujin.mar.chung You're welcome  Especially the good practice for commit messages are important. In the machine learning nanodegree we are asked to do a commit every day for two weeks before submitting our github to inspection. Recruiters pay attention to your commit frequency (the graphic in your homepage with green squares indicating how much you coded day after day), and to the most recent repositories, its readme.md, and the commit messages. This may be more important than many diplomae in our resume

If you use Ubuntu with your raspberry, I think it should be the same as with Linux Mint that I use.

By the way, I have a question:        ‎
In general I work with windows 10, But I like Linux Mint a lot, I succeeded in installing it on a 64GB USB ‎key, bootable directly on the USB key (I installed linux mint 19.1 on the USB key that works very well, ‎and it's fast), I tried to install pytorch 1.1 but I couldn't, and it can't accept Pytorch 1.0 or Pytorch 1.1  ‎my graphics card. I don't know if it's because my graphics card is old, I have a GTX 660TI from NVIDIA. ‎Could you please tell me how you have installed anaconda correctly and then create an environment to install ‎pytorch and pysyft in linux mint 19.1, because I would like to succeed in installing pytorch 1.1 and pysyft on mint 19.1

I am reading through chapter 2 of The Algorithmic Foundations of of Differential Privacy.
I read the first paper for the #reading_paper_discuss group, and took the corresponding quiz and survey. It was a good refresher on PCA, and why linear algebra is so integral to understanding machine learning.
I am curious, though: what happens if your data in non-linear? Is there an equivalent method for dimensionality reduction or feature extraction for non-linear data? The paper mentions ICA and kernel PCA, but I haven't every used these. Does anyone have experience with these methods and could give an example of how they used them?

Wasn't that a productive day. My laptop came back all new and healthy after a good one month at maintenance. So I tried to install anaconda / Jupyter notebook. Which sadly took more than half my day :/ faced so many problems and still couldn't Install it on my laptop! Then very helpful as @nishant.bharatindia suggested to use Google Colab.
Thankyou so much @nishant.bharatindia! 
1. Explored around Google colab and watched a few videos to learn about it.
2. Halfway through Andrew Ng's Machine learning course Lesson/ Week 2 videos! :party_parrot:

Day 2 of 60:
- Completed Inference & Validation tutorial:
Inference: Using a trained network to make predictions
Validation: Testing the model with the data that's not present in the training set
- Learned about Overfitting:
Overfitting is the tendency of neural networks to perform too well on training data and unable to generalise to data they haven't seen before.
If your network has a low training loss and high validation loss then we say, it overfits
Tackle overfitting. . .
1. Using a version of the model with lowest validation loss, known as EARLY STOPPING. It requires saving the model at frequent steps.
2. DROPOUT: Randomly dropping input units which enables the network to share information b/w weights thus generalising better to new data

Begin with the #60daysofudacity challenge, completed the following:

[2] Read the Book The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy, section 1: The Promise of Differential Privacy [page: 5 – 10].
[3] Working in the implementation of the project for the Lesson 3.
What I learn:
This was my first introduction to the field of Differential Privacy. As pointed out in the lectures, it is important to have a well defined framework, which allow us to define what is really to be private in the context of deep learning. Also, from the book, I can now see how the notion of privacy have been evolving. As with many field related in computer science, it is obvious to predict, that, in the future, the field will become more complex.

Day #3
Finally it’s the weekend and I can focus on studying.
1. Finished lesson 6. Trying to figure out how to do the final project. Skimmed through the course channel and looked for helpful resources. Special thanks to @0107wy for sharing your insight and your approach.
2. I am currently in a reading group from the community. The organiser launched a weekly quiz based on the course content. It was very challenging, but we encouraged each other in this journey. As @rupeshpurum quoted, “it doesn’t matter how slowly you go as long as you don’t stop.” I guess it’s also the essence of 60 Days Challenge.
ps. I happened to read a book (https://g.co/kgs/t6Jhfe) written by a famous AI leader in China, and would like to share his ted talk here:https://www.ted.com/talks/kai_fu_lee_how_ai_can_save_our_humanity?language=enAI is massively transforming our world, but there's one thing it cannot do: love. In a visionary talk, computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee details how the US and China are driving a deep learning revolution -- and shares a blueprint for how humans can thrive in the age of AI by harnessing compassion and creativity. ""AI is serendipity,"" Lee says. ""It is here to liberate us from routine jobs, and it is here to remind us what it is that makes us human.""

Day  I built, trained and fine-tuned my first basic GAN to generate new images of handwritten digits that look as if they’ve come from the original MNIST training data  
The below first picture displays the process of how the input latent vectors with random values become new images of hand-written digits. It starts out as all noise. Then the NN learns to make only the center white and the rest black.
The other picture shows the result of my 4th fine-tuning attempt and after 40 epochs of training: 16 samples of new, generated digits.

* The Definition of Differential Privacy - Cynthia Dwork https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg-VhHlztqo
* Differential privacy may lead to insufficient privacy protection for some users, while over-protecting others. Not all users require the same level of privacy, a higher level of utility can often be attained by not providing excess privacy to those who do not want it. As such here comes, Personalized differential privacy (PDP), a generalization of differential privacy in which users specify a personal privacy requirement for their data. https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7113353
* This article summarizes and draws connections among diverse streams of theoretical and empirical research on the economics of privacy. We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jel.54.2.442Differential privacy is widely accepted as a powerful framework for providing strong, formal privacy guarantees for aggregate data analysis.

Day 1: So happy to have finally begun my journey as a Secure and Private AI scholar. Thoroughly enjoying the learning experience. I have always enjoyed Neural Networks and was waiting for a great way to improve my understanding of the same. After cloning the notebook repo from Git, installing conda, PyTorch, numpy and Jupyter on my system, I went through the notebooks and attempted the exercises as required. So glad to have understood things with great clarity. A big thanks to Udacity and Facebook for making this happen. As of today, I have completed the Multilayer Layer Neural Networks section and am all set for Lesson 9 tomorrow. Signing up for #60daysofudacity has totally ignited the fire of learning in me!!! I feel confident that I am going to complete this rich, awesome learning experience and gain a lot from it. Grateful. Am about to find some people here so we can get this chain reaction of inspiration going....

Day 4:
I am going to change to something other. I had a headache yesterday reading CUDA Docs: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/index.html. Maybe to dilute that a little I would study Slack API as was suggested by @akshit and try to create a small app that gets the data from Slack. I recommend CUDA docs it is an extremely interesting read but pretty technical but the beauty of this product is huge.
IDEA: I thought about GPU operating system but Google showed Quora page why it might now work. But I keen to explore that as highly compute intensive tasks as search files can be implemented using GPU power and will be effective. And I saw a very nice example of that GPU search on Nvidia forum.
DISCOVERY: *Why GPU have a thousand cores and CPU only have 4 cores?* The answer is that that GPU core operations are very limited compared to CPU and they are doing tasks that can be divided into threads effectively. What it means is that if an operation is doing the same and outcome of one divisible operation does not connect to the outcome of another operation you can do that surely effectively and fastly on GPU.
Enjoy the challenge!

Day 3:
I reviewed the course Applied AI with Deep Learning from Coursera that touches the following concepts and applications:
1. Deep learning frameworks such as Tensorflow, SystemML, Keras, DeepLearning4J and of course, PyTorch.
2. Learned about Anomaly Detection, Time Series Forecasting, Image Recognition and Natural Language Processing by building up models using Keras on real-life examples from IoT, Financial Marked Data, Literature or Image Databases.
3. Scale deep learning models using Apache Spark and CUDA-enabled GPUs in IBM Cloud Jupyter Notebooks.

What i thought is we could create a spreadsheet and document the location of each slack user in the group and once we get a list you guys can easily filter out your country from the list and join in the meetups/watsapp groups listed in the sheet by other scholars who already started.

*Day:* 1/60
Today I wrote some Study Tips that helped me until now with this course (https://github.com/MarianoOG/Lesson-Notes-Secure-and-Private-AI/blob/master/Study%20Tips.md) I will still update this document from time to time.
I also define my strategy in general for the next 60 days. Because I already finished the videos of the course I will concentrate now on the projects that I skipped and I will create lesson notes that are understandable without the videos (that hopefully will help people like me that struggle to change between watching and programming). If somebody wants to help is more than welcome. 
---
:male-technologist: Code for #60daysofudacity here https://ona309.com/60DaysOfUdacityLesson notes from Udacity's Secure & Private AI course. - MarianoOG/Lesson-Notes-Secure-and-Private-AI# Study Tips For the course

Because of work I have been strugging to get time to work in this course. Few sleep and not as much progress as I would love to do. This is the list of thing I have done so far and that will probably help you as well to go trough this course (or others).

### Speed up

Use speed 2x or 3x in the videos (or as fast as you can handle), most of them have really long explanations or even pauses so it will be fine. If you struggle slow down if you are getting bored speed up. I recommend video control speed extension for chrome cause it lets you go beyond 2x that youtube offers natively.

### Skip not needed content

If you already have experience in some topic don't mind skipping parts or the whole video, theres no point in doing things double. If you have experience with machine learning probably Lesson 1 (intro to pytorch) its a bit slow for you, if you don't know about pytorch in specific but have used another framework whatch some tutorials instead on how to use the basic functions and then discover the rest when you need them.

### Watch videos fast, program the excersices slow

You may like to get your hands dirty, at least I like to do it. I learn more while tying to do stuff for myself so watch videos fast to get the idea but truly understand while doing the exercises, fork this notes or the original ones if you need. One of the things that were the most annoying for me is that the notes don't work as a standalone information, I always needed to refer to the video for explanations and details which took longer in the switching. At the end I either concentrate completly on watching or completly on doing. I will try to keep this notes self explanatory to make the work faster even without videos. (work in progress).

### Use the comunity as a curated search engine

If you don't get it in the first google search, ask somebody else that may know it. This will substantialy reduce the time it takes you to understand some concept tough the eyes of someone that already processed and used it succesfully.

### Search for questions on the matter and answer them

This is a hard step, only use it when you have certain confidence on the topic and you already got some code working. Doing this will bring you new insights on problems you may not tought about and/or different solutions. It will also make you revisit concepts to properly explain to others not only how but why something works in a certain way.

2. Found a good pneumothorax detection paper which lays out a scheme for using machine learning and other techniques for computer-aided pneumothorax diagnosis and segmentation. Have skimmed through it to get a gist of the publication. But am thinking the article deserves a thorough read and will definitely go through it again in detail.
3. Reviewed concepts in neural networks in deep learning in preparation for both individual and group projects for this challenge.

2. Udacity:
Perfect Privacy: A query to a database returns the same value even if we remove any person from the database.
Perfect Privacy (AI model): Training a model on a dataset should return the same model even if we remove any person from the training dataset
Two points of complexity: - Do we always know where ‘people’ are referenced in the dataset? - Neural models rarely ever train to the same location, even when trained on the same dataset twice
Hospital Data Scenario
- Ask each hospital to train a model on their own dataset
- Use each model to predict on your own local dataset, generating 10 labels for each datapoint
- Perform a DP query to generate the final true (DP) label for each datapoint
- Retrain a new model on our local dataset which now has DP labels

Hey Shaam, this group is to mention what you're doing during the 60 days of udacity challenge. Have a look at this link : https://secureprivataischolar.slack.com/archives/CJQ1C1X08/p1561616339402200@channel
*Announcing #60daysofudacity Challenge - http://bit.ly/spaic-60days * :60daysofudacitybadge:
We know you have been waiting for this since long. The long wait ends today! 
NOW is the time to start, so gear up :gottarun:and put your thinking caps on as the #60daysofudacity Challenge has just unfurled. :yay:
*:thinking_face:What needs to be done to ace this challenge? :thinking_face:* *STEP 1:* Make the pledge here - https://forms.gle/fkV3b2KuwVEKETnN8 *STEP 2:* Engage in *'atleast one'* of the following activities everyday:
1. Code or practice your program topics for 30 minutes everyday. :spiral_calendar_pad:
2. Attend a meet-up happening around you or better organise one! :handshake:
3. Gather a group of enthusiasts and engage in a group-project that would be based on your learnings in the program. (need not be restricted to the program learnings) :mario-luigi:
4.  Engross yourself in the Community Initiatives. :inception:
* STEP 3:* Post a short update in the #60daysofudacity Slack Channel about what you did that day, don't forget to note which day you are on! (Use Pictures & link to Github Repos if Required ) For Example:
*DAY 1:* I took part in a meetup!
*DAY 15:* I completed lesson 5!
*DAY 60:* I completed my group project and the challenge! :penguin_dance:
* STEP 4:* Encourage at least 2 people in Slack every day to follow this path! You can make group with them as well and maybe engage in any of the activities above.
And YES, this will be counted towards your 'Community Involvement, not to mention this will help you in polishing your program specific skills.  *So you can now do your meetups and post updates about it on the channel and they will be counted. *
*All the best & Stay Udacious! :60daysofudacitybadge::udacity:*
*P.S.* We will be introducing you to a new Community Manager tomorrow. She is AWESOME!! :celebrate:

Did I just forget to post day 3? Yes. Yes, I did forget to log into Slack.
Day 3:
- Got stuck on the first project in lesson 3. Also resolving some dependencies because I was using another computer to do the tasks.
Day 4:
- Got stuck on the second project in lesson 3. Guess I'll have to do lesson 3 at a slower pace than lesson 2, that one was a breeze.
I'd like to give shoutouts to my amazing encouragement buddies @ewotawa@anjumercian85@khandelwalcibaca!! I wish I can be more active, now that I've wrapped up some events

Day #4
:female-technologist: Started lesson 7 in Federated Learning. Completed 1-7. The concept is like distributed systems or edge computing, I suppose, in a way that the end device downloads the model from the cloud and trains locally with users’ data. Then upload the model back to the central server in order to share with everyone. Without end user even notice, everything is running in the background. Quite interesting! Signed up for a Kahoot Sunday quiz. Look forward to the game! Read an interesting article how an AI App helps quit smoking:https://techgrabyte.com/ai-help-people-quit-smoking/ Started a thread in wmn_who_code about an evil application of GAN is to undress woman’s image:https://techgrabyte.com/deepnude-ai-undressed-women-deepfakes/?fbclid=IwAR3Vwu508ipRIUMlWP1OBeViDSeDZI2Tm6RP2A738hNpUofKkVxtqGJHA9M Watched a TED Talk about how AI could become an extension of your mind. At the first glance it’s kind of creepy, but then the idea seems like embedding a computer inside a human body. The application I can think of is that people with this sticker will probably have better chance to ace the job interviews. https://www.ted.com/talks/arnav_kapur_a_breakthrough_device_that_combines_mind_and_machineResearcher created an mchine learning algorithms that heps to break smoking habit, it has been trained over the data of people who actually quit smoking.DeepNudes is an app that “undressed” photos of women. It uses GAN, to creates a new realistic, naked image of that same person.Try talking to yourself without opening your mouth, by simply saying words internally. What if you could search the internet like that -- and get an answer back? In the first live public demo of his new technology, TED Fellow Arnav Kapur introduces AlterEgo: a wearable AI device with the potential to let you silently talk to and get information from a computer system, like a voice inside your head. Learn more about how the device works and the far-reaching implications of this new kind of human-computer interaction.

*DAY 2 [3.3%] | 60* #60daysofudacity
[1] Implementation of the project 2 for the Lesson 3 completed.
[2] Added a plot for the project, where the data distribution can be compared using two databases.
[3] Taking a recap from Lesson 3.
*What I learn:*
This was a very interesting project, where we created a main database, containing a single feature with ones and zeros. Also, we implemented a function to create more databases from the main one, with one row missing per database (a total of 5000 dbs). I noticed how we select the probability distribution for the samples to be 50%. This give me the idea to plot the density distribution for the databases using different probabilities. In fact, I plot a standard DB with p = 0.5 against one with p = 0.7. This help me to understand how the probability parameter affected the creation of the databases.

Day 4 of #60daysofudacity
1. Went through the lesson and project for Additive Secret Sharing which involves a special type of Cryptography for aggregating data in an encrypted state so no individual will actually see what those data gradients are.
2. Worked on pre-processing the dataset I'm using for the APTOS Diabetic Retinopathy Kaggle Competition

*DAY 4*: I finished lesson 3, learned about Differential Privacy and how to build a private database in python.
I encourage @roberto.terceros57 and @rozamiera to follow this path!
DAY 3: I finished lesson 2, learned about working on a GPU environment while using transfer learning with pre-trained models such as DenseNet and ResNet with Kaggle Datasets.
DAY 2: I learned about Inference, Validation, Precision and Recall. The Validation/Dropout solutions, and lastly about how to save/load the models as checkpoints.
DAY 1: I accepted the challenge and continued learning lesson 2: Deep Learning with PyTorch modeling with the MNIST dataset.#60daysofudacity & #UdacityFacebookScholar #aiuio #aisaturdays #ArtificialIntelligence
