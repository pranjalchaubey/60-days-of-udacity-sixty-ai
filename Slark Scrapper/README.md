# Dataset Generation for Sixty
This web scraper was written from scratch to extract meaningful data from the *Slark* 60DaysOfUdacity channel. 

Raw HTML pages from which the dataset was generated cannot be uploaded as they have a massive size (100MB+). 

The author of this notebook has a *free-running* method of writing comments. This means that you can observe what the author was thinking at a particular time. There were a number of times where his thought process was wrong. Such comments have not been deleted, so as to give the new programmers an idea about the thought process that goes inside the head of coder while writing code. 

The extracted data from the HTML pages is kept inside the *data* folder.
